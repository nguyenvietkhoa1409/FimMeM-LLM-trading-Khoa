evaluations for over 2.3 million individuals participating in medicare advantage and other managed care plans in 2022. acos are an alternative payment model where a range of providers take responsibility for the cost of a patient\\'s healthcare over the course of a year with the goal of improving quality and operational efficiency and sharing in any savings achieved as a result of such coordination. our aco services are intended to help our clients generate and receive shared savings. these services include, but are not limited to, population health software, analytics, practice improvement, compliance, and governance. we provide our aco services primarily through caravan health, inc., which we acquired on march 1, 2022. we believe that these core solutions have enabled us to becom e integral to how health plans and healthcare providers successfully participate in value-based payment programs, and that our platform lessens the dependence on facility-centric care for acute and post-acute services and shifts more services towards alternate sites and, most importantly, the home. our solutions support value-based payment programs by aligning financial incentives around outcomes, providing tools to health plans and healthcare organizations designed to assess and manage risk and identify actionable opportunities for improved patient outcomes, coordination and cost-savings. through our platform, we coordinate what we believe is a holistic suite of clinical, social, and behavioral services to address an individual\\'s healthcare needs and prevent adverse events that drive excess cost. our business model is aligned with our customers, as we generate revenue when we successfully engage members for our health plan customers and generate savings for our provider customers. recent developments and factors affecting our results of operations as a result of a number of factors, our historical results of operations may not be comparable to our results of operations in future periods, and our results of operations may not be directly comparable from period to period. set forth below is a discussion of the key factors impacting our results of operations. unless otherwise specified, all amounts relate to our continuing operations only. pending acquisition on september 2, 2022, we entered into an agreement and plan of merger (the \"merger agreement\") with cvs pharmacy, inc., a rhode island corporation (\"parent\"), and noah merger sub, inc., a delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of parent (\"merger subsidiary\"), pursuant to which, among other things, merger subsidiary will merge with and into the company and whereupon merger subsidiary will cease to exist and the company will be the surviving corporation in the merger (the \"surviving corporation\") and will continue as a wholly-owned subsidiary of parent (the \"merger\"). at the effective time of the merger (the \"effective time\"), each share of our class a common stock (other than (i) common stock owned by the company, parent or merger subsidiary or any subsidiary thereof and (ii) any shares of class a common stock and our class b common stock owned by stockholders who properly exercise appraisal rights under delaware law), including each share of class a common stock resulting from the exchange of llc units (as defined below), outstanding immediately prior to the effective time, shall be canceled and converted into the right to receive $30.50 per share in cash, without interest (such per-share consideration, the \"per share consideration\" and the aggregate consideration, the \"merger consideration\"). pursuant to the merger agreement, immediately prior to the effective time, in accordance with the merger agreement, the third amended and restated limited liability company agreement of cure topco llc (\"cure topco\"), dated as of february 12, 2021 (the \"cure topco amended llc agreement\") and our certificate of incorporation, (i) we will require each member of cure topco (excluding the company and the company holding subsidiary (as defined in the merger agreement), but including cure aggregator, llc) to effectuate a redemption of all of such cure topco member\\'s llc units (as defined in the cure topco amended llc agreement) (\"llc units\"), pursuant to which such llc units will be exchanged for shares of class a common stock on a one-for-one basis in accordance with the provisions of the cure topco amended llc agreement and the merger agreement and (ii) each share of class b common stock shall automatically be canceled immediately upon the consummation of such redemptions, such that no shares of class b common stock will remain outstanding immediately prior to the effective time. consummation of the merger is subject to certain conditions, including, but not limited to, (i) our receipt of the approval of the merger agreement by stockholders holding a majority of the voting power of the outstanding shares of common stock, (ii) the expiration or early termination of the applicable waiting period under the hart-scott-rodino antitrust improvements act of 1976, (iii) the absence of any law or order prohibiting or making illegal the consummation of the merger, (iv) the absence of any material adverse effect (as defined in the merger agreement) on the company and (v) the tra amendment (as defined below) being in full force and effect in accordance with its terms and not having been amended, repudiated, rescinded, or modified. on october 31, 2022, stockholders holding a majority of the voting power of the outstanding shares of common stock approved the merger agreement. on september 19, 2022, each of the company and parent filed its respective notification and report form with the u.s. department of justice (the \"doj\") and the u.s. federal trade commission (collectively, the \"agencies\") under the hsr act. on october 19, 2022, the company and parent each received a request for additional information and documentary materials (collectively, the \"second request\") from the doj in connection with the doj\\'s review of the merger. the effect of the second request is to extend the waiting period imposed under the hsr act until the 30th day after substantial compliance by the company and parent with the second request, unless the waiting period is terminated earlier by the doj or extended by the parties to the merger. the company has made customary representations and warranties in the merger agreement and has agreed to customary covenants regarding the operation of the business of the company and its subsidiaries prior to the effective time. the merger agreement contains certain termination rights for each of the company and parent. upon termination of the merger agreement in accordance with its terms, under certain specified circumstances, the company will be required to pay parent a termination fee in an amount equal to $228.0 million, including if the merger agreement is terminated due to the company accepting a superior proposal or due to the company\\'s board changing its recommendation to the company\\'s stockholders to vote to approve the merger agreement. the merger agreement further provides that parent will be required to pay the company a termination fee in an amount equal to $380.0 million in the event the merger agreement is terminated under certain specified circumstances and receipt of antitrust approval has not been obtained by such time. if the merger is consummated, the company will cease to be a publicly traded company and will become a wholly owned subsidiary of parent, and our common stock will be delisted from the nyse and deregistered under the exchange act. we recorded approximately $18.2 million of transaction-related costs associated with the pending merger primarily related to banker fees, professional services fees and employee retention bonuses as transaction-related expenses in our consolidated statement of operations during the year ended december 31, 2022. the foregoing description of the merger agreement does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by, the full text of the merger agreement, which was filed as exhibit 2.1 to the current report on form 8-k filed by the company with the sec on september 6, 2022 and also attached as annex a to the definitive proxy statement. episodes of care restructuring and exit on july 7, 2022, our board approved a restructuring plan to wind down our former episodes of care business. this decision was made in light of recent retrospective trend calculations released by the center for medicare & medicaid innovation in june 2022 that lowered target prices for episodes in the bpci-a program, and which we believe have made the program unsustainable. the total cost of the restructuring plan was initially estimated to be approximately $25-$35 million comprised of severance and related employee costs, contract termination fees and professional service fees as well as facility closure costs. we recorded total restructuring expenses of $23.3 million during the year ended december 31, 2022, which represents the majority of the restructuring plan costs. total restructuring expenses during the year ended december 31, 2022 include $21.1 million related to and included in the loss on discontinued operations, net of tax and $2.1 million included as restructuring expenses on our consolidated statement of operations. total restructuring expenses for the year ended december 31, 2022 are comprised of $11.7 million for severance and related employee costs, $9.9 million in contract termination fees and $1.6 million for professional service fees. we also incurred approximately $1.0 million related to facility exit costs which are included in the loss on discontinued operations on our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december 31, 2022. we expect to incur some additional costs in connection with the restructuring plan actions in the first quarter of 2023. historically, there were approximately $85 million of annualized direct episodes of care costs which we eliminated by the end of 2022. in addition, there were approximately $60 million of annualized shared costs historically allocated to the former episodes of care wind-down segment, of which we eliminated approximately $34 million in annualized costs by the end of 2022 as we ceased operations in our former episodes of care business. in addition, we expect to eliminate an additional $3 million in annualized shared costs by the end of the first half of 2023 as we complete the overall re-alignment of cost structures throughout the organization due to the exit of the episodes of care business. as a result of the elimination of these stranded costs, not all of which related directly to the discontinued operations, we expect a positive impact to 2023 results of operations. as of december 31, 2022, all operations in the former episodes of care services business ceased and as a result our financial statements for all periods presented herein have been recast to report the former episodes of care wind-down segment as discontinued operations. caravan health acquisition on march 1, 2022, we completed the acquisition of caravan health for an initial purchase price of approximately $250.0 million, subject to certain customary adjustments, and included $190.0 million in cash and $60.0 million in our class a common stock, comprised of 4,762,134 shares at $12.5993 per share, which represented the volume-weighted average price per share of our common stock for the five trading days ending three business days prior to march 1, 2022. in connection with and concurrently with the entry into the caravan health merger agreement, we entered into support agreements with certain shareholders of caravan health, pursuant to which such shareholders agreed that, other than according to the terms of their respective support agreement, they will not, subject to certain limited exceptions, transfer, sell or otherwise dispose of any signify shares for a period of up to five years following closing of the merger. in addition to the initial purchase price, the transaction included contingent additional payments of up to $50.0 million based on certain future performance criteria of caravan health, which if such criteria are met, would be paid in the second half of 2023. the initial fair value of the contingent consideration as of the acquisition date was estimated to be approximately $30.5 million. the contingent consideration is payable based on the achievement of certain performance criteria, one of which is revenue. both performance criteria must be achieved for any payment to be due. as of december 31, 2022, the estimated fair value of contingent consideration has decreased since the acquisition date as the estimated revenue for 2022 is below the threshold to earn any of the payment due to new information received from cms during the year ended december 31, 2022 and therefore the likelihood of the defined revenue criteria being achieved is unlikely . while caravan health revenue for 2022 will not be deemed final until receipt of the final reconciliation from cms in the second half of 2023, the performance period to earn the payment ended as of december 31, 2022. therefore, the value of the contingent consideration is estimated to be zero as of december 31, 2022. see \"--results of operations.\" during the year ended december 31, 2022, in accordance with the terms of the caravan health merger agreement we calculated the final net working capital adjustment to the initial purchase price which resulted in an additional $0.9 million cash consideration due to the sellers. this additional amount due was primarily related to adjustments of the estimated contract assets based on the final reconciliation received from cms for the 2021 performance periods and updated income tax estimates. we paid the additional cash consideration in the fourth quarter of 2022. as part of the caravan health acquisition, we assigned preliminary values to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based upon their fair values at the acquisition date. we acquired $93.9 million of intangible assets, consisting primarily of customer relationships of $69.8 million (10-year useful life), acquired technology of $23.4 million (5-year useful life) and a tradename of $0.7 million (3-year useful life), which increased our amortization expense in 2022 and we expect will do so in future periods. as a result of the caravan health acquisition, we also recorded $199.5 million in goodwill, which represented the amount by which the purchase price exceeded the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired. pro forma results of operations related to this acquisition have not been presented as the acquisition did not meet the prescribed significance tests set forth in regulation s-x requiring such disclosure. the financial results of caravan health have been included in our consolidated financial statements since the date of the acquisition. due to the above factors, and in particular the increase in amortization expense, our results of operations for periods subsequent to the acquisition are not directly comparable to our results of operations for the periods prior to the acquisition date. impact of ihe volume and margins our revenue and profitability are affected by the number of ihes we complete during a period and how cost effectively we are able to complete them. the number of ihes we are able to complete during a period can be affected by a variety of factors. for example, decisions by our customers with respect to the member list, including any increase or reduction in the number of members included in the member list (or the member list from which it is derived), may impact our ihe completion rate and, as a result, our revenue. similarly, our ability to complete ihes is affected by the level of member engagement. in our experience, members of existing customers are more likely to have had an ihe from us in the past and are more likely to be responsive to our outreach. in contrast, for new customers, their members are often just getting to know us and may have never had an ihe before, which can make it harder to successfully contact them and obtain their consent to an ihe. our ability to complete ihes is also affected by the capacity of our mobile network of providers, which impacts our ability to efficiently reach all of the members on our member lists. the capacity of our mobile network is affected by our ability to recruit and retain providers in our contracted network. as overall healthcare utilization increases, demand for providers from other participants in the healthcare industry increases, which may make it more difficult for us to recruit new providers and retain existing providers. the capacity of our mobile network is also affected by factors such as the ability of providers to obtain necessary state licenses within a reasonable timeframe, the availability of pandemic-related waivers that allow providers to provider services in states in which they are not licensed, the willingness of providers to make more of their time available to us, and our ability to efficiently schedule appointments and route providers to maximize the number of ihes they are able to complete in a day. we believe we will benefit from demographic trends in the coming years. as the u.s. population ages, the number of medicare eligible individuals is increasing. moreover, according to cms, medicare advantage is growing faster than the medicare classic or ffs program. we believe we are well positioned to capture the growth in medicare advantage enrollment in the coming years and further increase the number of members to whom we provide ihes. our long-term profitability is also impacted by how cost-effectively we are able to complete ihes. for example, it tends to be less costly for us to perform ihes in densely populated urban areas and more costly for us to perform ihes in difficult-to-reach or less densely populated areas. our ability to cost-effectively perform ihes is also affected by how efficiently we are able to schedule a provider\\'s day to maximize the number of ihes he or she is able to complete in a day. the mix of providers we use may also impact our costs. we use a mix of physicians, nurse practitioners and physicians\\' assistants, with physicians being the most costly to contract with for ihes. if we increase or decrease our usage of a particular type of provider, it impacts the average cost of performing ihes and our margins. as previously indicated, as overall healthcare utilization increases, demand for providers from other participants in the healthcare industry is increasing, which may create pressure for us to increase provider compensation in certain geographic areas in order to recruit and retain providers in our network. this pressure may be exacerbated by rising inflation in the united states. these and other factors may further impact the average cost of performing ihes and our margins. during the year ended december 31, 2022, we completed and sent to customers approximately 2.34 million ihes, including vihes, compared to 1.91 million ihes, including vihes, in the year ended december 31, 2021. in 2022, the higher ihe volume was driven by increased customer demand partially offset by certain vendor technology issues. seasonality historically, there has been a seasonal pattern to our revenue generated by our ihe related services, with the revenues in the fourth quarter of each calendar year generally lower than the other quarters. each year, our ihe customers provide us with a member list, which may be supplemented or amended during the year. our customers generally limit the number of times we may attempt to contact their members. throughout the year, as we complete ihes and attempt to contact members, the number of members who have not received an ihe and whom we are still able to contact declines, typically resulting in fewer ihes scheduled during the fourth quarter. in 2020, the covid-19 pandemic led to a large number of in-person ihes being conducted in the second half of the year, particularly in the fourth quarter, and as a result, for 2020, we did not see the historical seasonality we would normally expect with respect to ihe volume. in 2021 and 2022, we returned to a seasonality trend related to our ihe services more consistent with historical trends, with fewer ihes being conducted in the fourth quarter, compared to the second and third quarters. however, any further developments with respect to timing of receiving member lists from our customers and/or customer demand may impact seasonality trends. covid-19 our operations were significantly affected by the covid-19 pandemic in early 2020 as we temporarily paused ihes in march 2020 and shortly thereafter expanded our business model to perform vihes in order to make up for some of the lost ihe volume. we resumed in-person visits beginning in july 2020. despite the availability of vihes, many of our customers had postponed ihes to the second half of 2020. overall, we saw significant incremental ihe volume in the second half of 2020, particularly in the fourth quarter, related to this catch-up and additionally as certain customers increased the overall volumes they placed with us. in order to meet this volume growth, we onboarded additional providers into our network which resulted in proportionally higher expenses. in 2021, the vast majority of our evaluations were ihes, although we continued to perform vihes. o verall, ihe volume in 2021 was strong and increased 33% compared to 2020. late in the fourth quarter of 2021 and into early 2022, there were once again covid-19 surges across the country, particularly related to omicron and other variants. while this did impact provider availability temporarily, we did not experience a significant decline in ihe volume or significant shift in mix from ihes to vihes as a result of the various covid-19 surges in late 2021 or throughout 2022. equity-based compensation expense on march 1, 2022, our board approved amendments to certain outstanding equity award agreements, subject to performance-based vesting criteria . the equity awards were amended with an effective date of march 7, 2022, and included 3,572,469 outstanding common units in cure aggregator (the \"incentive units\") and 817,081 outstanding stock options. the amendments added an alternative two-year service-vesting condition to the performance-vesting criteria, which, through the effective date of the amendment, were considered not probable of occurring and, therefore, we had not previously recorded any expense related to these awards. the amended equity awards will now vest based on the satisfaction of the earlier to occur of 1) a two year service condition, with 50% vesting in each of march 2023 and march 2024 or 2) the achievement of the original performance vesting criteria. as a result of this amendment, which results in vesting that is considered probable of occurring, we began to record equity-based compensation expense for these amended equity awards in march 2022. the equity-based compensation expense related to these amended awards is based on the fair value as of the effective date of the amended equity awards and will be recorded over the two year service period. the total fair value on the amendment date for the march 2022 amended incentive units was based on the closing stock price on the amendment date of $14.19, resulting in total fair value of $50.7 million, of which we recorded $19.5 million in equity-based compensation expense during the year ended december 31, 2022. of this amount, $0.5 was related to discontinued operations. subsequent to these amendments, as of december 31, 2022, there were 1,367,924 incentive units that remain outstanding that are subject only to performance-based vesting conditions that are not probable of occurring. the total fair value on march 7, 2022, the amendment effective date, based on a black-scholes value of $8.49, was $6.9 million for the march 2022 amended stock options as described above, of which we recorded $2.8 million during the year ended december 31, 2022. of this amount, $0.3 was related to discontinued operations. as a result of these amendments, there are no longer any stock options outstanding that are subject only to performance-based vesting conditions that are not probable of occurring. additionally, in march 2022, our board and the compensation & talent committee approved annual long-term incentive plan equity grants (the \"2022 annual ltip equity grants\") to certain employees. a total of 2,677,979 restricted stock units and 4,059,520 stock options with an exercise price of $14.19 were granted as part of this 2022 annual ltip equity grants. all awards granted as part of the 2022 annual ltip equity grants vest in equal annual installments over four years. the total grant date fair value related to the 2022 annual ltip equity grants was $68.8 million and will be recorded as equity-based compensation expense over the four year service period beginning in march 2022. as a result of the march 2022 amendments to equity awards with performance-based vesting criteria and the 2022 annual ltip equity grants, our total equity-based compensation expense is expected to be significantly higher in 2022 and beyond as compared to historical periods. adoption of new accounting pronouncement - leases in february 2016, the fasb issued asu 2016-02, leases (asc 842) which requires lessees to recognize leases on the balance sheet by recording a right-of-use asset and lease liability. we adopted this new guidance as of january 1, 2022 and applied the transition option, whereby prior comparative periods will not be retrospectively presented in the consolidated financial statements. we elected the package of practical expedients not to reassess prior conclusions related to contracts containing leases, lease classification and initial direct costs and the lessee practical expedient to combine lease and non-lease components for all asset classes. we made a policy election to not recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases for all asset classes. see note 9 to our audited consolidated financial statements included in item 8 elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k for further details. upon adoption on january 1, 2022, we recognized right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for operating leases of $23.0 million and $35.6 million, respectively. the difference between the right-of-use asset and lease liability primarily represents the net book value of deferred rent and tenant improvement allowances recognized as of december 31, 2021, which was adjusted against the right-of-use asset upon adoption. non-controlling interest the non-controlling interest ownership percentage changes as new shares of class a common stock are issued and llc units are exchanged for our class a common stock. during the year ended december 31, 2022, the change in the non-controlling interest percentage was primarily driven by the shares issued in connection with the caravan health acquisition as well as exchanges of llc units into class a common stock. as of december 31, 2022, we held approximately 75.6% of cure topco\\'s outstanding llc units and the remaining llc units of cure topco are held by the continuing pre-ipo llc members. investment in growth and technology we continue to invest in sustaining significant growth, expanding our suite of solutions and being able to support a larger customer base over time. achievement of our growth strategy will require additional investments and result in higher expenses and higher cash outflows being incurred, particularly in developing new solutions, as well as in technology and human resources, as we aim to achieve this growth without diluting or decreasing the level and quality of services we provide. developing new solutions can be time- and resource-intensive, and even once we launch a new solution, it can take a significant amount of time to contract with customers, provide them with our suite of technology and data analytics tools and have them actually begin generating revenue. this may increase our costs for one or more periods before we begin generating revenue from new solutions. in addition to developing new solutions, we are making significant investments in developing our existing solutions and increasing capacity. we will continue to invest in our technology platform and human resources to empower our providers and our customers to further improve results and optimize efficiencies. however, our investments may be more capital intensive or take longer to develop than we expect and may not result in operational efficiencies. in 2022, we announced our plans to open a technology center in ireland to expand our access to skilled technology resources in support of our growth strategy. expanding internationally has resulted and will continue to result in additional infrastructure costs as well as increased risks. see \"--item 1a. risk factors--risks related to our limited operating history, financial position and future growth--we may be subject to risks that arise from operating internationally.\" cost of being a public company our operating costs have increased in absolute terms as we develop, manage and train management level and other employees to comply with ongoing public company requirements and incur other expenses, including costs related to our public reporting obligations, which includes increased professional fees for accounting, legal, compliance with sarbanes-oxley act, proxy statements and stockholder meetings, equity plan administration, stock exchange fees and transfer agent fees. in addition, we are party to the tax receivable agreement with the tra parties and are required to make certain cash payments to them in accordance with the terms of the tax receivable agreement. see \"--liquidity and capital resources--tax receivable agreement.\" effects of the reorganization on our corporate structure signify health was formed for the purpose of the ipo, which was effective in february 2021, and had no activities of its own prior to such date. we are a holding company and our sole material asset is a controlling ownership of profits interest in cure topco. all of our business is conducted through cure topco and its consolidated subsidiaries and affiliates, and the financial results of cure topco and its consolidated subsidiaries are included in our consolidated financial statements for periods subsequent to the reorganization transactions. cure topco is currently taxed as a partnership for federal income tax purposes and, as a result, its members, including after the reorganization transactions and the ipo, signify health, pay taxes with respect to their allocable share of its net taxable income. we expect that redemptions and exchanges of the \"llc units\" will result in increases in the tax basis in our share of the tangible and intangible assets of cure topco that otherwise would not have been available. these increases in tax basis may reduce the amount of tax that we would otherwise be required to pay in the future. the tax receivable agreement requires us to pay to the tra parties 85% of the amount of cash savings, if any, in u.s. federal, state and local income tax or franchise tax that we actually realize from these tax basis increases and other tax attributes discussed herein. furthermore, payments under the tax receivable agreement will give rise to additional tax benefits and therefore additional payments under the tax receivable agreement. components of our results of operations revenue our revenue is generated from contracts with our customers that contain various fee structures. we offer multiple solutions to our customers, including, among others, health evaluations performed either within the patient\\'s home, virtually or at a healthcare provider facility, primarily to medicare advantage health plans, diagnostic & preventive services, aco enablement services, a provider enablement platform, 340b referrals and return to home services, revenue is recognized for ihe services when the ihes are submitted to our customers on a daily basis. submission to the customer occurs after the ihes are completed and coded, a process which may take one to several days after completion of the evaluation. we are paid a flat fee for each completed ihe regardless of the member\\'s location or the outcome of an ihe. we earn a separate fee for any additional diagnostic screenings the health plan elects to provide for the relevant member. revenue is recognized when the additional screening occurs. we have entered into ear agreements and a separate letter agreement (the \"ear letter agreement\") with one of our customers. revenue generated under the underlying customer contracts includes an estimated reduction in the transaction price for ihes associated with the initial grant date fair value of the outstanding customer ear agreements and ear letter agreement. the total grant date fair value of the outstanding ear agreements was $51.8 million and was recorded against revenue over their respective performance periods, both of which ended in december 2022. the grant date fair value of the ear letter agreement was estimated to be $76.2 million and is being recorded as a reduction of revenue through june 30, 2026, coinciding with the service period as follows: $6.3 million in 2022, $20.0 million in 2023, $20.0 million in 2024, $19.9 million in 2025 and $10.0 million in 2026. see \"--liquidity and capital resources--customer equity appreciation rights agreements.\" our subsidiary, caravan health, enters into contracts with customers to provide multiple services around the management of the aco model. these include, among others, population health software, analytics, practice improvement, compliance, and governance. the overall objective of the services provided is to help the customer receive shared savings from cms. caravan health enters into arrangements with customers wherein we receive a contracted percentage of each customer\\'s portion of shared savings if earned. we recognize shared savings revenue as performance obligations are satisfied over time, commensurate with the recurring aco services provided to the customer over a 12-month calendar year period. the shared savings transaction price is variable, and therefore, we estimate an amount we expect to receive for each 12-month calendar year performance obligation period. in order to estimate this variable consideration, management initially uses estimates of historical performance of the acos. we consider inputs such as attributed patients, expenditures, benchmarks and inflation factors. we adjust our estimates at the end of each reporting period to the extent new information indicates a change is warranted. we apply a constraint to the variable consideration estimate in circumstances where we believe the data received is incomplete or inconsistent, so as not to have the estimates result in a significant revenue reversal in future periods. although our estimates are based on the information available to us at each reporting date, new and material information may cause actual revenue earned to differ from the estimates recorded each period. these include, among others, hierarchical conditional category (\"hcc\") coding information, quarterly reports from cms with information on the aforementioned inputs, unexpected changes in attributed patients and other limitations of the program beyond our control. we receive final reconciliations from cms and collect the cash related to shared savings earned annually in the third or fourth quarter of each year for the preceding calendar year. the remaining sources of aco services revenue are recognized over time when, or as, the performance obligations are satisfied and are primarily based on a fixed fee or per member per month fee. therefore, they do not require significant estimates and assumptions by management. see \"--critical accounting policies--revenue recognition.\" operating expenses operating expenses are composed of: * service expense. service expense represents direct costs associated with generating revenue. these costs include fees paid to providers for performing ihes, provider travel expenses and the total cost of payroll, related benefits and other personnel expenses for employees in roles that serve to provide direct revenue generating services to customers. additionally, service expense also includes costs related to the use of certain professional service firms, member engagement expenses, coding expenses and certain other direct costs. * selling, general and administrative expense (\"sg&a\"). sg&a includes the total cost of payroll, related benefits and other personnel expense for employees who do not have a direct role associated with revenue generation. sg&a includes all general operating costs including, but not limited to, rent and occupancy costs, telecommunications costs, information technology infrastructure and operations costs, software licensing costs, advertising and marketing expenses, recruiting expenses, costs associated with developing new service offerings and expenses related to the use of certain subcontractors and professional services firms. sg&a includes significant legal, accounting and other expenses associated with being a public company, including, among others, costs associated with our compliance with the sarbanes-oxley act and other regulatory requirements. * transaction-related expenses. transaction-related expenses primarily consist of expenses incurred in connection with the pending merger, acquisitions and other corporate development such as mergers and acquisitions activity that did not proceed, strategic investments and similar activities, including consulting expenses, compensation expenses and other integration-type expenses. additionally,

revenue $ 805.5 100.0 % $ 653.1 100.0 % 23.3 % ##table_end our total revenue was $805.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2022, representing an increase of $152.4 million, or 23.3%, from $653.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2021. this increase was primarily driven by evaluations revenue, which increased by $124.6 million. the higher evaluations revenue was driven by increased ihe volume, including more diagnostic and preventative screenings, and a reduction in the proportion of ihes conducted as vihes, which are performed at a lower price per evaluation compared to in-person ihes. evaluations revenue included a reduction associated with the grant date fair value of the outstanding customer ears and ear letter agreement of $26.0 million and $19.7 million during the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. revenue for value-based care services was $32.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2022. we did not have any value-based care services in 2021 because we acquired caravan health, through which we provide these services, in 2022. other revenue decreased by $4.8 million, primarily due to a decrease in revenue from our biopharmaceutical services which we exited in 2021 and standalone sales of our social determinants of health community product, which we made the decision to exit in 2022. operating expenses our total operating expenses were $725.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2022, representing an increase of $148.7 million, or 25.8%, from $577.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2021. this increase was driven by the following: * service expense - our total service expense was $440.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2022, representing an increase of $88.9 m illion, or 25.3%, from $351.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2021 . this increase was primarily driven by expenses related to our network of providers, which increased by $51.4 million as compared to the year ended december 31, 2021, driven by the overall higher ihe volume as well as a higher mix of in-person ihes compared to vihes, which have a lower cost per evaluation. compensation-related expenses increased by $31.1 million, primarily driven by additional headcount, including the incremental employees retained as part of the caravan health acquisition and higher benefits expense. additionally, the following expenses increased during the year ended december 31, 2022, primarily driven by the overall higher ihe volume: $3.3 million in other variable costs; $2.6 million in the costs of providing other diagnostic and preventive services, including certain laboratory and testing fees; $1.8 million in member outreach services and other related expenses, and $0.3 million in travel related costs. the impact of covid-19 was less in 2022, resulting in a decrease of approximately $1.6 million in pandemic-related expenses during 2022 as compared to 2021, including lower costs related to covid-19 tests for our providers and lower costs for personal protective equipment used by our providers while conducting ihes. * sg&a expense - our total sg&a expense was $202.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2022, representing an increase of $28.5 million, or 16.5%, from $173.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2021 . this increase was primarily driven by equity-based compensation which increased $31.0 million primarily due to additional equity grants and the amendment of awards with performance-based vesting to include a time-based vesting condition. compensation-related expenses increased by $23.2 million due to additional headcount to support the overall growth in our business including incremental employees as part of the caravan health acquisition and higher benefits costs. additionally, information technology-related expenses, including infrastructure and software costs, increased $5.4 million, employee travel and entertainment expenses increased $2.3 million as covid-19 imposed travel restrictions eased, and facilities related expenses increased $1.9 million driven by new locations and expenses related to the early exit of certain locations in connection with our approved restructuring activities. these increases were offset by a decrease of $30.5 million in the remeasurement of contingent consideration in 2022 related to p otential payments in connection with our acquisition of caravan health in march 2022. the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration decreased since the acquisition date primarily due to the lower caravan health shared savings revenue estimates for 2022, which is one of the performance criteria needed to achieve payment . professional service fees also decreased $4.0 million primarily due to higher costs in 2021 as a result of being a newly public company and other variable costs decreased $0.8 million in 2022. * transaction-related expenses - our total transaction-related expenses were $23.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2022, representing an increase of $13.9 million, or 141.3%, from $9.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2021. in 2022, the transaction-related expenses consisted primarily of legal, consulting, professional services expenses and employee related costs in connection with the pending merger and consulting and other professional services incurred in connection with general corporate development activities, including the caravan health acquisition. in addition, transaction-related expenses in 2022 included certain integration-related expenses, including compensation expenses and consulting and other professional services expenses, following the caravan health acquisition. in 2021, the transaction-related expenses consisted primarily of consulting and other professional services, as well as compensation expenses, incurred in connection with our ipo and general corporate development activities, including potential acquisitions that did not proceed. * restructuring expenses - our total restructuring expenses were $2.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2022. we did not have any restructuring expenses for the year ended december 31, 2021. the restructuring expense in 2022 included severance and related employee costs, contract termination fees and professional services fees due to the overall restructuring and cost realignment in connection with the wind-down and exit of our former episodes of care business. see \"--recent developments and factors affecting our results of operations --episodes of care restructuring\". * loss on impairment - our total loss on impairment was $3.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2022. we did not record a loss on impairment for the year ended december 31, 2021. we recorded a loss on impairment during the year ended december 31, 2022 in connection with the decision to end our community service offering and therefore the carrying value of the underlying intangible assets exceeded the estimated fair value. the loss on impairment included a $3.0 million impairment of acquired technology and a $0.3 million impairment of customer relationships. * depreciation and amortization - our total depreciation and amortization expense was $53.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2022, representing an increase of $12.0 million, or 28.7%, from $41.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2021. this increase in depreciation and amortization expense was primarily driven by a net increase in amortization expense of $11.3 million, primarily due to the $93.9 million in intangible assets acquired in connection with the caravan health acquisition in march 2022 and additional capital expenditures related to internally-developed software over the past year partially offset by asset impairments over the past year. additionally, there was an increase in depreciation expense of $0.7 million, primarily driven by additional capital expenditures over the past year. other expense, net other expense, net total was $216.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2022, representing an increase of $186.9 million from $29.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2021. interest expense was $20.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2022, representing a decrease of $1.1 million from $21.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2021. this decrease was primarily driven by the lower outstanding term loan principal balance following our june 2021 refinancing of the 2021 credit agreement, partially offset by higher overall interest rates. in 2021, we recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of $5.0 million in connection with the june 2021 refinancing of the 2021 credit agreement. other (income) expense was $195.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2022, representing an increase of $193.0 million from $2.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2021. this increase was primarily driven by the remeasurement of the fair value of the outstanding customer ear liabilities, which resulted in expense of $202.1 million for year ended december 31, 2022, representing an increase of $194.8 million from expense of $7.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2021. the fair value of the outstanding customer ear liabilities increased due to our higher equity value and a revised estimate of the time to liquidity as a result of the pending merger. this increase in net expense was partially offset by a $5.8 million increase in interest income earned on higher excess cash balances and rising interest rates during the year ended december 31, 2022. additionally, during the year ended december 31, 2021, we recorded a $4.0 million adjustment to our liability under the tra; there was no adjustment to the tra liability in 2022. income tax (benefit) expense income tax benefit from continuing operations was $6.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2022, compared to income tax expense from continuing operations of $13.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2021. the continuing operations effective tax rate for the year ended december 31, 2022 was 4.6% compared to 29.6% for the year ended december 31, 2021. the effective tax rate in 2022 is lower than the u.s. federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to a change in valuation allowance and the impact of non-controlling interest. the effective tax rate in 2021 was higher than the u.s. federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to unrealizable net operating losses which require a valuation allowance and the impact of state taxes. loss on discontinued operations, net of tax discontinued operations includes the results of operations, financial position and cash flows for the former episodes of care business. loss on discontinued operations, net of tax, was $653.3 million in 2022, representing an increase of $630.3 million from a loss of $23.0 million in 2021. this loss was primarily due to an increase in loss on impairment of $508.7 million related to the write-off of goodwill and intangible assets triggered by the decision to exit the business and a decrease of $158.7 million in revenue due to the negative impact of cms imposed pricing adjustments resulting in lower savings estimates and the reversal of revenue previously recorded. these decreases were partially offset by lower compensation and employee-related costs in connection with the wind-down of operations associated with the approved restructuring activities in 2022. for the years ended december 31, 2021 and 2020 the following is a discussion of our consolidated results of operations for the year ended december 31, 2021 compared to the year ended december 31, 2020. the following table summarizes our results of operations for the periods presented: ##table_start year

$450.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2020. this increase was primarily driven by evaluations revenue, which increased by $204.3 million. the higher evaluations revenue was driven by increased ihe volume and a reduction in the proportion of ihes conducted as vihes, which are performed at a lower price per evaluation compared to in-person ihes. evaluations revenue included a reduction associated with the outstanding customer ears of $19.7 million and $12.4 million during the years ended december 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. other revenue decreased by $1.8 million, primarily due to a decrease in standalone sales of our social determinants of health product. operating expenses our total operating expenses were $577.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2021,

driven by expenses related to our network of providers, which increased by $45.9 million, driven by the higher ihe volume and a return to a more traditional mix of in-person ihes compared to vihes. in 2020, as a result of covid-19, a higher proportion of evaluations were performed as vihe, which have a lower cost per evaluation. compensation-related expenses increased by $25.9 million primarily driven by additional headcount and higher incentive pay to support growth. additionally, the following expenses increased during the year ended december 31, 2021, primarily driven by the overall higher ihe volume: an increase of $9.5 million in the costs of providing other ancillary services, including certain laboratory and testing fees; an increase of approximately $4.1 million in member outreach and other related expenses; and an increase of $0.8 million in other variable costs. the impact of covid-19 resulted in an increase of approximately $0.2 million in expenses, including costs

representing an increase of $6.0 million, or 16.7%, from $35.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2020. this increase in depreciation and amortization expense was primarily driven by a net increase in amortization expense of $4.6 million, primarily due to additional capital expenditures related to internally-developed software over the past year, partially offset by certain intangible assets becoming fully amortized in 2020. additionally, there was an increase in depreciation expense of $1.4 million, primarily driven by additional capital expenditures over the past year. other expense, net other expense, net was $29.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2021, representing a decrease of 1.7 million, or 6.1%, from $31.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2020. interest expense was $21.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2021, representing a decrease of $0.5 million from $22.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2020. this decrease was primarily driven by the lower outstanding principal balance and lower interest rates following our june 2021 refinancing. in 2021, we recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of $5.0 million in connection with the june 2021 refinancing of the 2021 credit agreement. other expense was $2.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2021, representing a decrease of $6.2 million from $9.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2020. this decrease was primarily driven by a $4.0 million adjustment to our liability under the tax receivable agreement in 2021. the remeasurement of the fair value of the outstanding customer ear liabilities resulted in expense of $7.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2021, representing a decrease of $1.9 million from expense of $9.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2020. the fair value of the outstanding customer ear liabilities decreased in 2021 due to the lower equity value at the end of 2021 partially offset of the accretion of the liability over the performance period. additionally, the decrease in other expense was partially offset by an increase of $0.3 million interest income earned on higher excess cash balances and rising interest rates during the year ended december 31, 2021. income tax expense income tax expense from continuing operations was $13.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2021, representing an increase of $12.8 million from $0.9 million in income tax expense from continuing operations for the year ended december 31, 2020. as a result of the reorganization transactions, we are now subject to corporate income taxes on our share of the total net income (loss). prior to the reorganization transactions, we were not subject to corporate income taxes, as cure topco is a partnership for u.s. tax purposes. the effective tax rate for 2021 was 29.6%, which is higher than the u.s. federal tax rate of 21% primarily due to unrealizable net operating losses which require a valuation allowance and the impact of the state taxes. (loss) income on discontinued operations, net of tax discontinued operations includes the results of operations, financial position and cash flows for the former episodes of care business. loss on discontinued operations, net of tax, was $23.0 million in 2021, representing a decrease of $48.1 million from income of $25.1 million in 2020. this loss was primarily due to a decrease of $39.7 million in revenue. this decrease in revenue was primarily driven by the adverse effects of covid-19 on program size and savings rate, including lower healthcare utilization, the exclusion of episodes of care with a covid-19 diagnosis and the impact of the patient case mix adjustment and inpatient rehabilitation center utilization on savings rate. additionally, sg&a expenses increased by $7.8 million and we recorded a loss on impairment of $11.2 million in 2021. sg&a expenses were higher in 2021 primarily driven by higher employee related costs and the asset impairment related to a technology intangible asset acquired through the patientblox acquisition, which was considered impaired due to a delay in the launch of a new episodes product utilizing such technology. quarterly

meet the cash requirements of our business operations, including working capital needs to meet operating expenses, debt service, acquisitions when pursued and other commitments and contractual obligations. we consider liquidity in terms of cash flows from operations and their sufficiency to fund our operating and investing activities. our primary sources of liquidity are our existing cash and cash equivalents, cash provided by operating activities and borrowings under our 2021 credit agreement, including borrowing capacity under our revolving facility (as defined below). as of december 31, 2022, we had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of $466.1 million. our total indebtedness was $345.6 million as of december 31, 2022. in june 2021, we entered into a credit agreement with a secured lender syndicate (the \"2021 credit agreement\"). the 2021 credit agreement includes a term loan of $350.0 million (the \"2021 term loan\") and a revolving credit facility (the \"revolving facility\") with a $185.0 million borrowing capacity. see \"--indebtedness\" below. as of december 31, 2022, we had available borrowing capacity under the revolving facility of $172.8 million, as the borrowing capacity is reduced by outstanding letters of credit of $12.2 million. our principal liquidity needs are working capital and general corporate expenses, debt service, capital expenditures, obligations under the tax receivable agreement, income taxes, acquisitions and other investments to help achieve our growth strategy. in march 2022, we acquired caravan health, using approximately $189.6 million in cash, net of the cash acquired from caravan health. we paid an additional $0.9 million to the sellers of caravan health in the fourth quarter 2022 related to the working capital adjustment as defined in the purchase agreement. in addition, we issued approximately $60.0 million of our class a common stock, comprised of 4,762,134 shares at $12.5993 per share, which represented the volume-weighted average price per share of our common stock for the five trading days ending three business days prior to march 1, 2022. under the terms of the caravan health merger agreement, there could be a contingent payment made to the sellers of caravan health in 2023 of up to $50 million if certain milestones are achieved. however, based on total estimated revenue recognized for caravan health in 2022, we do not expect to make any contingent payments. see note 14 to our audited consolidated financial statements included in item 8 elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k. payment of the outstanding customer ear liabilities would be triggered by the consummation of the merger, which we expect to occur within the next 12 months. see \"--recent developments and factors affecting our results of operations --pending acquisition.\" as of december 31, 2022, the total estimated fair value of the outstanding ear agreements was $276.7 million. our capital expenditures for property and equipment to support growth in the business were $8.0 million and $6.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. on july 7, 2022, our board approved a restructuring plan to wind down our former episodes of care services segment. see \"--recent developments and factors affecting our results of operations --episodes of care wind-down restructuring.\" the total cost of the restructuring plan is estimated to be approximately $25-$35 million and will consist of severance and related employee costs, contract termination fees and professional service fees as well as facility closure costs. we recorded total restructuring expenses of $23.3 million during the year ended december 31, 2022, which represents the majority of the restructuring plan costs. however, there are some costs associated with the restructuring plan actions to be completed in the first half of 2023. our liquidity has historically fluctuated on a quarterly basis due to our agreements with cms under the bpci-a program and will be further impacted due to our exit of the bpci-a program and our episodes of care business. see \"--recent developments and factors affecting our results of operations --episodes of care wind-down restructuring.\" although our operations in the former episodes of care business ceased by december 31, 2022, cash receipts and disbursements under these contracts are subject to semiannual reconciliation cycles, which historically occurred in the second and fourth quarters of each year and will continue to be received through the fourth quarter of 2024 when we expect to receive the reconciliation for our final results under the bpci-a program. cash receipts and disbursements under these contracts were typically received and paid in the quarter subsequent to the receipt of the reconciliation, or during the first and third quarters of each year, which has resulted and will continue to cause our liquidity position to fluctuate from quarter to quarter until the final reconciliations are received and ongoing disputes with cms are resolved when these will no longer be sources or uses of cash. due to our dispute of the pricing adjustment in the semiannual reconciliation received from cms during the second quarter of 2022, the cash we typically would have received in the third quarter of 2022 was delayed until cms issued a final reconciliation for that period in december 2022 and are expected to be received during the first quarter of 2023. in addition, caravan health\\'s participation in the cms mssp aco program will also result in fluctuations in liquidity from period to period, as this is a calendar year program, with annual shared savings reconciled and distributed approximately nine months after the calendar year program ends. for example, we received the shared savings funds from cms in the fourth quarter of 2022 related to the 2021 aco plan year and expect to receive the 2022 aco plan year shared savings in the third or fourth quarter of 2023. we also have historically experienced seasonality patterns in ihe volume as described in \" --recent developments and factors affecting our results of operations\" above. in 2022, our quarterly seasonality returned to the pre-covid-19 seasonality patterns. generally, we experience the highest volumes in the second quarter of each year with the lowest volumes in the first and fourth quarter of each year, thus creating a seasonality effect on liquidity. additionally, liquidity was temporarily impacted by delayed collections on ihes during the first half of 2022 from certain clients where we experienced significant expansion. we experienced improved collections during the third quarter of 2022 as we continuously worked with our clients to resolve some of the temporary delays; however, collections were again delayed in the fourth quarter of 2022. in the first quarter of 2022, we announced the development of a technology center in galway, ireland to support our operations in the united states. we hired our first employees there in 2022. effective april 1, 2022, we entered into a lease agreement for a facility in galway, ireland. the lease term is 15 years with an option to terminate after 10 years. it is not reasonably certain that we will not exercise the option to terminate after 10 years; therefore, the total lease payments are expected to be approximately $7.0 million over 10 years. this foreign denominated lease and ongoing development of this new technology center as well as the continued hiring of employees has resulted and will continue to require capital funding and expose us to currency risk. we believe that our cash flows from operations, capacity under our revolving facility and available cash and cash equivalents on hand will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for at least the next 12 months. we anticipate that to the extent that we require additional liquidity, it will be funded through the incurrence of additional indebtedness, the issuance of additional equity, or a combination thereof. we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain this additional liquidity on reasonable terms, or at all. additionally, our liquidity and our ability to meet our obligations and fund our capital requirements are also dependent on our future financial performance, which is subject to general economic, financial and other factors that are beyond our control. see \"part i--item 1a. risk factors.\" accordingly, we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available from additional indebtedness or otherwise to meet our liquidity needs. if we decide to pursue one or more significant acquisitions, we may incur additional debt or sell or issue additional equity to finance such acquisitions, which could possibly result in additional expenses or dilution. indebtedness on june 22, 2021, our subsidiaries, cure intermediate 3, llc, as \"holdings,\" and signify health, llc, as \"borrower,\" entered into a credit agreement (the \"2021 credit agreement\") with barclays bank plc as administrative agent and collateral agent (the \"administrative agent\"), the guarantors party thereto from time to time and the lenders party thereto from time to time, consisting of term loans in an aggregate principal amount of $350.0 million (the \"2021 term loan\") and a revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $185.0 million (the \"revolving facility\"). the obligations under the 2021 credit agreement are secured by substantially all of the assets of holdings, the borrower and its wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries (subject to customary exceptions and exclusions), including a pledge of the equity of each of its subsidiaries. the 2021 credit agreement replaced all previously outstanding long-term indebtedness. the 2021 term loan amortizes at 1.00% per annum in quarterly installments of 0.25% commencing with the first payment in december 2021, and will mature on june 22, 2028. the revolving facility matures on june 22, 2026. the 2021 term loan bears interest at a rate of the base rate plus 2.25% for base rate loans or the eurocurrency rate plus 3.25% for eurocurrency rate loans, provided that upon and any time after the public corporate credit rating of the borrower is first rated \"b+\" or higher by standards and poors\\' rating agency (\"s&p\") following june 22, 2021, the applicable rate with respect to the 2021 terms loan shall be permanently reduced by 0.25% for both eurocurrency rate loans and for base rate loans. in july 2022, our corporate credit rating was upgraded by s&p to b+, which per the terms of the 2021 credit agreement, reduced the applicable rate for the 2021 term loan by 25 basis points effective july 2022. however, rising interest rates have offset this reduction. borrowings under the revolving facility initially bore interest at a rate of the base rate plus 1.75% for base rate loans or the eurocurrency rate plus 2.75% for eurocurrency rate loans and letter of credit fees and, undrawn commitment fees equal to 0.25%. since the delivery of financial statements for the first full quarter after june 22, 2021, the interest rate for borrowings under the revolving facility is based on the consolidated first lien net leverage ratio pricing grids below. in addition, upon and any time after the public corporate credit rating of the borrower is first rated b+ or higher by s&p subsequent to june 22, 2021, the applicable rate with respect to the revolving facility and letter of credit fees shall be permanently reduced by 0.25% at each pricing level in the pricing grids below in july 2022, our corporate credit rating was upgraded by s&p to b+, which per the terms of the 2021 credit agreement, reduced the applicable rate w ith respect to the revolving facility and letter of credit fees by 25 basis points effective july 2022. however, rising interest rates have offset this reduction. ##table_start pricing level consolidated first lien net leverage ratio eurocurrency rate loans and letter of

restrict the ability of the borrower and its restricted subsidiaries to make certain payments, incur additional debt, engage in certain asset sales, mergers, acquisitions or similar transactions, create liens on assets, engage in certain transactions with affiliates, change its business, make investments and may limit or restrict the borrower\\'s ability to make dividends or other distributions to us. in addition, the 2021 credit agreement contains a springing financial covenant requiring the borrower to maintain its consolidated first lien net leverage ratio (as defined in the 2021 credit agreement) at or below 4.50:1.00 as of the last day of any fiscal quarter in which the principal amount of all revolving loans and letters of credit (other than undrawn letters of credit) exceed 35% of the revolving credit commitments at such time. comparative cash flows the following table sets forth our cash flows for the periods indicated: ##table_start year ended december 31, 2022 2021 2020 (in millions) net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations $ 98.0 $ 77.8 $ 24.2 net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations (219.1) (26.7) (28.4) net cash provided by financing activities from continuing operations 1.2 524.4 33.1 ##table_end operating activities net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was $98.0 million in 2022, an increase of $20.2 million, compared to net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations of $77.8 million in 2021. net loss from continuing operations was $130.4 million in 2022, as compared to net income of $32.9 million in 2021. the net loss in 2022 was primarily due to the remeasurement of the outstanding customer ear liabilities which increased in value due to our higher stock price since the announcement of the merger value partially offset by revenue growth including the impact of the caravan health acquisition. non-cash items were $275.6 million in 2022 as compared to $83.3 million in 2021. the increase in non-cash net expense items included in net loss was primarily driven by the remeasurement of the outstanding customer ear liabilities in 2022 compared to 2021. changes in operating assets and liabilities resulted in a cash decrease of $47.2 million in 2022, as compared to a cash decrease of $38.4 million in 2021. the change in operating assets and liabilities was primarily driven by the following: * a net increase in accounts receivable of $37.7 million in 2022 compared to a net increase in accounts receivable of $29.8 million in 2021. the increase in accounts receivable in 2022 was primarily driven by higher ihe volume in 2022 and delayed collections for certain large clients at the end of 2022. accounts receivable fluctuate from period to period as a result of seasonality and periodically slower client collections, particularly related to our ihe services as we and our clients reconcile claims and resolve any temporary claims processing delays; and * a net increase of $15.3 million in contract assets in 2022 compared to a net increase in contract assets of $1.5 million in 2021. the increase in contract assets in 2022 was primarily driven by the estimated shared savings under our participation in the mssp aco program, which we began participating in as part of our acquisition of caravan health in march 2022. additionally, contract assets in 2022 include management\\'s estimate of amounts to be received from clients as a result of certain variable consideration discounts over an extended contract term for a large client; and * a net increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets of $12.2 million in 2022 compared to no significant change in prepaid expenses and other current assets in 2021. the increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets in 2022 was primarily driven by an income tax receivable related to tax refunds due to us; partially offset by * a net increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $27.9 million in 2022 compared to a net decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $9.3 million in 2021. the increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses in 2022 was primarily driven by amounts due to certain mssp aco customers related to the 2023 aco payment mechanism in which we have an offsetting amount held as restricted cash, and higher accrued expenses at the end of 2022 related to transaction expenses related to the merger, accrued restructuring expenses and provider related costs associated with higher ihe volumes. net cash provided by operating activities was $77.8 million in 2021, an increase of $53.6 million, compared to $24.2 million in 2020. net income from continuing operations was 32.9 million in 2021, as compared to a net loss from continuing operations of $39.6 million in 2020. the increase in net income was primarily due to growth in evaluations revenue partially offset by an increase in operating expenses to support the future growth in the overall business. non-cash items were $83.3 million in 2021 as compared to $71.3 million in 2020. the increase in non-cash items included in net income was primarily due to increased amortization expense due to additional capital expenditures related to internally-developed software over the year and loss on extinguishment of debt in connection with the june 2021 refinancing of our credit agreement partially offset by adjustments to the tax receivable agreement liability. changes in operating assets and liabilities resulted in a cash decrease of $38.4 million in 2021, as compared to a cash decrease of $5.7 million in 2020. the change in operating assets and liabilities was primarily driven by a net increase in accounts receivable of $29.8 million in 2021 compared to a net increase in accounts receivable of $44.3 million in 2020. the increase in accounts receivable as of december 31, 2021 as compared to december 31, 2020 primarily as a result of the increase in in-person ihe volumes in 2021. the net impact of changes in contract assets and liabilities during 2021 was a $2.3 million increase in cash for the year ended december 31, 2021 as compared to a $1.4 million increase in cash for the year ended december 31, 2020. the increase in net contract liabilities is due to management\\'s estimate of potential refund liabilities due to certain clients as a result of certain service levels not being achieved during the contractual periods. an increase in operating expenses as a result of the investments to support our growth and technology has further impacted our working capital needs. accounts receivable, contract assets and contract liabilities fluctuate from period to period as a result of periodically slower client collections and the results of the semi-annual reconciliations in our episodes of care services segment. investing activities net cash used in investing activities was $219.1 million in 2022, an increase of $192.4 million, compared to net cash used in investing activities of $26.7 million in 2021. the primary use of cash from investing activities in 2022 was the cash consideration, net of cash acquired, for the caravan health acquisition of $190.5 million. capital expenditures for property and equipment were $8.0 million in 2022 compared to $6.7 million in 2021. the $1.3 million increase in capital expenditures for property and equipment was primarily driven by computer equipment purchases. capital expenditures for internal-use software development were $20.3 million in 2022 compared to $15.0 million in 2021. the $5.3 million increase in capital expenditures for internal-use software development was primarily driven by additional investments in our technology platforms to support future growth. investing activities also included a $0.3 million equity investment in aloecare health in 2022 and a $5.0 million equity investment in medalogix, inc. in 2021. net cash used in investing activities was $26.7 million in 2021, a decrease of $1.7 million, compared to net cash used in investing activities of $28.4 million in 2020. capital expenditures for property and equipment were $6.7 million in 2021 compared to $13.9 million in 2020. the $7.2 million decrease in capital expenditures for property and equipment was primarily driven by investments in certain facilities in 2020 and other requirements to support the future growth in the business. capital expenditures for internal-use software development were $15.0 million in 2021 compared to $13.5 million in 2020. the $1.5 million increase in capital expenditures for internal-use software development was primarily driven by additional investments in our technology platforms to support future growth. investing activities also included a $5.0 million equity investment in medalogix, inc. in 2021 and a $1.0 million equity investment in centerhealth in 2020. financing activities net cash provided by financing activities was $1.2 million in 2022, a decrease of $523.2 million, compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $524.4 million in 2021. the source of cash in 2022 was primarily due to $11.7 million related to the issuance of common stock in connection with the exercise of stock options partially offset by $6.5 million in tax distributions on behalf of the non-controlling interest and scheduled principal payments under our 2021 credit agreement of $3.5 million. the primary source of cash from financing activities in 2021 was $604.5 million in net proceeds from our ipo after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other issuance costs. additionally, we received $5.9 million in proceeds related to the issuance of common stock in connection with the exercise of stock options. these cash inflows in 2021 were partially offset by the net reduction in long-term debt of $61.5 million in connection with the june 2021 refinancing of our credit agreement as well as scheduled principal payments on long-term debt of $1.9 million. additionally, we paid approximately $13.0 million in tax distributions on behalf of the non-controlling interest and $9.2 million in debt issuance costs in connection with the june 2021 refinancing. net cash provided by financing activities was $33.1 million in 2020. the primary source of cash provided by financing activities in 2020 was proceeds of $140.0 million from the issuance of the long-term debt. additionally, we received approximately $1.0 million in net income tax refunds on behalf of new remedy corp. and $2.9 million in proceeds related to the issuance of common stock under stock plans. these sources of cash in 2020 were partially offset by the repurchase of curetopco and cure aggregator member units for $56.9 million, payment of contingent consideration of $38.2 million related to a 2017 acquisition, tax distributions to members of cure aggregator and cure topco of $8.2 million, payment of debt issuance costs of $5.1 million and scheduled principal payments on long-term debt under our then outstanding credit agreement of $2.8 million. dividend policy assuming cure topco makes distributions to its members in any given year, the determination to pay dividends, if any, to our class a common stockholders out of the portion, if any, of such distributions remaining after our payment of taxes, tax receivable agreement payments and expenses (any such portion, an \"excess distribution\") will be made at the sole discretion of our board. our board may change our dividend policy at any time. see \"item 5. market for registrant\\'s common equity, related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities.\" tax receivable agreement we are a party to the tax receivable agreement with the tra parties, under which we generally are required to pay to the tra parties 85% of the amount of cash savings, if any, in u.s. federal, state and local income tax that we actually realize as a result of (i) certain favorable tax attributes we acquired from certain entities treated as corporations for u.s. tax purposes that held llc units (the \"blocker companies\") in connection with each of their mergers with and into a merger subsidiary created by us (and which survived such merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of signify health), after which each blocker company immediately merged into signify health (with each such merger into signify health having occurred simultaneously) (the \"mergers\") (including net operating losses, the blocker companies\\' allocable share of existing tax basis and refunds of taxes attributable to pre-merger tax periods), (ii) increases in our allocable share of existing tax basis and tax basis adjustments that may result from (x) future redemptions or exchanges of llc units by continuing pre-ipo llc members for cash or class a common stock, (y) the contribution of llc units in exchange for shares of class a common stock by new mountain partners v (aiv-c), lp and (z) certain payments made under the tax receivable agreement and (iii) deductions in respect of interest and certain compensatory payments made under the tax receivable agreement. these payment obligations are our obligations and not obligations of cure topco. our obligations under the tax receivable agreement also apply with respect to any person who is issued llc units in the future and who becomes a party to the tax receivable agreement. we do not anticipate making payments under the tax receivable agreement until after the 2021 tax return has been finalized. the company, cure topco and certain other parties thereto entered into a tax receivable agreement and llc agreement amendment, dated as of september 2, 2022 (the \"tra amendment\") which (i) amends (x) the tax receivable agreement among the company, cure topco and certain other parties thereto and (y) the cure topco amended llc agreement and (ii) provides for certain covenants regarding tax reporting and tax-related actions. the tra amendment provides for (i) the termination of all payments under the tra from and after the effective time of the merger agreement, (ii) the payment of any amounts due under the tra prior to the effective time (other than payments resulting from an action taken by any party to the tra after the date of the tra amendment, which will be suspended), in accordance with the terms of the tra, which payments will be paid no earlier than 185 days following the filing of the u.s. federal income tax return of the company, (iii) a prohibition on the company terminating the tra or accelerating obligations under the tra after the date of the tra amendment and (iv) the termination of the tra effective as of immediately prior to and contingent upon the occurrence of the effective time (including termination of all of the company\\'s obligations thereunder and the obligation to make any of the foregoing suspended payments). the tra amendment also includes agreements among the parties thereto regarding the preparation of tax returns and limits actions that may be taken by the company, cure topco and certain of their controlled affiliates after the effective time. the tra amendment also (i) suspends all tax distributions under the cure topco amended llc agreement from and after the effective time, and (ii) provides that from and after the effective time, no person or entity shall have any further payment or other obligation under the tra or any obligation to make or pay tax distributions under the cure topco amended llc agreement. in the event the merger agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, (i) the tra amendment will become null and void ab initio (provided that any payments suspended as described above are required to be made), (ii) the tra and the cure topco amended llc agreement will continue in full force and effect as if the tra amendment had never been executed (provided that any suspended payments as described above are required to be made), and (iii) all of the company\\'s obligations under the cure topco amended llc agreement will continue in full force and effect as if the tra amendment had never been executed. the foregoing description of the tra amendment does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by, the full text of the tra amendment which was filed as exhibit 99.2 to the current report on form 8-k filed with the sec on september 6, 2022. customer equity appreciation rights (\"ear\") agreements in each of december 2019 and september 2020, we entered into ear agreements with one of our customers. pursuant to the agreements, certain revenue targets were established for the customer to meet in the following three years. if they met those targets, they would retain the ear. if they did not meet such targets, they would forfeit all or a portion of the ear. each ear agreement allows the customer to participate in the growth in the fair market value of our equity and can only be settled in cash (or, under certain circumstances, in whole or in part with a replacement agreement containing substantially similar economic terms as the original ear agreement) upon a change-in-control of us, other liquidity event, or upon approval of our board with the consent of new mountain capital subject to certain terms and conditions. each ear will expire 20 years from the date of grant, if not previously settled. pursuant to the terms of the ear agreements, the value of the ears will be calculated as an amount equal to the non-forfeited portion of a defined percentage (3.5% in the case of the december 2019 ear and 4.5% in the case of the september 2020 ear) of the excess of (i) the aggregate fair market value of the reference equity (as defined below) as of the applicable date of determination over (ii) a base threshold equity value defined in each agreement. pursuant to the terms of each agreement, the \"reference equity\" is the class a common stock of the company and the aggregate fair market value of the reference equity will be determined by reference to the volume-weighted average trading price of the company\\'s class a common stock (assuming all of the holders of llc units redeemed or exchanged their llc units for a corresponding number of newly issued shares of class a common stock) over a period of 30 calendar days. in addition, following the ipo, the base threshold equity value set forth in each agreement was increased by the aggregate offering price of the ipo. on december 31, 2021, we entered into an amendment of the december 2019 ear and the september 2020 ear (collectively, the \"ear amendments\"). the ear amendments provide, among other things, that the customer may exercise any unexercised, vested and non-forfeited portion of each ear upon the sale of our class a common stock by new mountain capital, our sponsor, subject to certain terms and conditions. these terms and conditions include, among others, that the customer has met its revenue targets under each ear for 2022 and that new mountain capital has sold our class a common stock above a certain threshold as set forth in each amendment. we have the option to settle any portion of the ears so exercised in cash or in class a common stock, provided that the aggregate amount of any cash payments do not exceed $25.0 million in any calendar quarter (with any amounts exceeding $25.0 million to be paid in the following quarter or quarters). we and our customer also agreed to extend our existing commercial arrangements through the middle of 2026 and established targets for the minimum number of ihes to be performed on behalf of the customer each year (the \"volume targets\"). the ear amendments did not result in any incremental expense as the fair value at the time of modification did not exceed the fair value of the original december 2019 ear and september 2020 ear immediately prior to the modification. accordingly, we continued to recognize the original grant date fair value of the 2019 ear and 2020 ear awards as a reduction to revenue. we also entered into the ear letter agreement with the customer that provides that, in the event of a change in control of the company or certain other corporate transactions, and subject to achievement of the volume targets, if the aggregate amount paid under the ears prior to and in connection with such event (the \"aggregate ear value\") is less than $118.5 million, then the customer will be paid the difference between $118.5 million and the aggregate ear value. the ear letter agreement was determined to be a separate equity-linked instrument, independent from the original ears, as amended. the grant date fair value was determined based on an option pricing model. similar to the original ears, we recorded the initial grant date fair value as a reduction to revenue over the performance period. estimated changes in fair market value are recorded each accounting period based on management\\'s current assumptions related to the underlying valuation approaches as other (income) expense, net on the consolidated statement of operations. the grant date fair value of the ear letter agreement was estimated to be $76.2 million and will be recorded as a reduction of revenue through june 30, 2026, coinciding with the service period. the ear letter agreement was executed on december 31, 2021 and, therefore, there was no material impact on our results of operations in 2021. as of december 31, 2022, due to the change in control and liquidity provisions of each ear, cash settlement of the ears is expected to occur following the close of the pending merger and will be paid based on the $30.50 per share defined in the merger agreement. the grant date fair value of the december 2019 ear was estimated to be $15.2 million and was recorded as a reduction of revenue through december 31, 2022, coinciding with the three-year performance period. the grant date fair value of the september 2020 ear was estimated to be $36.6 million and was recorded as a reduction of revenue through december 31, 2022, coinciding with the 2.5-year performance period. as of december 31, 2022, the total combined estimated fair market value of the ears, as amended, and ear letter agreement was approximately $276.7 million. as of december 31, 2022, the original customer ear agreements were both fully earned, with no forfeiture having occurred. non-gaap financial measures adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin are not measures of financial performance under gaap and should not be considered substitutes for gaap measures, including net income or loss, which we consider to be the most directly comparable gaap measure. adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin have limitations as analytical tools, and when assessing our operating performance, you should not consider these non-gaap financial measures in isolation or as substitutes for net income or loss or other consolidated income statement data prepared in accordance with gaap. other companies may calculate adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. we define adjusted ebitda as net (loss) income before interest expense, loss from discontinued operations, loss on extinguishment of debt, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization and certain items of income and expense, including asset impairment, other (income) expense, net, transaction-related expenses, restructuring expenses, equity-based compensation, remeasurement of contingent consideration, seu expense and non-recurring expenses. we believe that adjusted ebitda provides a useful measure to investors to assess our operating performance because it eliminates the impact of expenses that do not relate to ongoing business performance, and that the presentation of this measure enhances an investor\\'s understanding of the performance of our business. adjusted ebitda is a key metric used by management and our board to assess the performance of our business. we believe that adjusted ebitda provides a useful measure to investors to assess our operating performance because it eliminates the impact of expenses that do not relate to ongoing business performance, and that the presentation of this measure enhances an investor\\'s understanding of the performance of our business. we believe that adjusted ebitda margin is helpful to investors in measuring the profitability of our operations on a consolidated level. our use of the terms adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin may vary from the use of similar terms by other companies in our industry and accordingly may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin have important limitations as analytical tools. for example, adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin: * do not reflect any cash capital expenditure requirements for the assets being depreciated and amortized that may have to be replaced in the future; * do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; * do not reflect the impact of certain cash charges resulting from matters we consider not to be indicative of our core operations; * do not reflect the interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt; and * do not reflect equity-based compensation expense and other non-cash charges; and exclude certain tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us. adjusted ebitda increased by $41.9 million, or 25.9%, to $203.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2022 from $161.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2021. adjusted ebitda increased by $94.4 million, or 140.4%, to $161.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2021 from $67.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2020. the increase in both periods was primarily driven by the growth in ihe volume. we define adjusted ebitda margin as adjusted ebitda divided by revenue. we believe that adjusted ebitda margin is helpful to investors in measuring the profitability of our operations on a consolidated basis. adjusted ebitda margin increased approximately 50 basis points to 25.3% for the year ended december 31, 2022 from 24.8% for the year ended december 31, 2021. adjusted ebitda margin increased approximately 980 basis points to 24.8% for the year ended december 31, 2021 from 14.9% for the year ended december 31, 2020. the following table shows a reconciliation of net (loss) income to adjusted ebitda for the periods presented: ##table_start year ended december 31, 2022 2021 2020

that underlie our signify community platform that we made the decision in 2022 to no longer offer. (b) represents other non-operating (income) expense that consists primarily of the quarterly remeasurement of fair value of the outstanding customer ears and ear letter agreement as well as interest and dividends earned on cash and cash equivalents. (c) represents transaction-related expenses that consist primarily of expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions and other corporate development activities, including the pending merger and the caravan health acquisition and related integration expenses as well as potential acquisitions that did not proceed, strategic investments and similar activities. expenses incurred in connection with our ipo, which cannot be netted against proceeds, are also included in transaction-related expenses in 2021. (d) represents restructuring expense related to our exit of our former episodes of care wind-down segment. restructuring expense includes severance and related employee costs, contract termination fees and professional services fees. (e) represents expense related to equity incentive awards, including incentive units, stock options and rsus, granted to certain employees, officers and non-employee directors as long-term incentive compensation. we recognize the related expense for these awards ratably over the vesting period or as achievement of performance criteria become probable. (f) represents the reduction of revenue related to the grant date fair value of the customer ears granted pursuant to the customer ear agreements we entered into in december 2019 and september 2020, as amended and the ear letter agreement we entered into in december 2021. (g) represents remeasurement of contingent consideration in 2022 related to potential payments due upon completion of certain performance targets in connection with the caravan health acquisition. as of december 31, 2022, the estimated fair value of the potential contingent consideration related to caravan health was reduced to zero as the estimated revenue, one of the two performance criteria required for achievement of the contingent consideration, was below the minimum threshold. in 2020, represents the remeasurement of contingent consideration due to the selling shareholders of censeo health, a business acquired in 2017, pending the resolution of an irs tax matter. the matter was resolved in 2020. (h) represents compensation expense related to awards of synthetic equity units (\"seus\") subject to time-based vesting. a limited number of seus were granted in 2020 and 2021 at the time of the ipo; no future grants of seus have been made. compensation expense related to these awards is tied to the 30-trading day average price of our class a common stock, and therefore is subject to volatility and may fluctuate from period to period until settlement occurs. (i) represents certain gains and expenses incurred that are not expected to recur, including those associated with the closure of certain facilities, one-time employee termination benefits and the early termination of certain contracts as well as one-time expenses associated with the covid-19 pandemic. contractual obligations and commitments our material cash requirements include non-cancelable purchase commitments, lease obligations, debt and debt service, payments under the tra and settlement of the outstanding customer ears, among others. see note 13 long-term debt and note 21 commitments and contingencies to our audited consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k , and \"--indebtedness\" and \"--customer equity appreciation rights agreements\" for further details. in addition, as of december 31, 2022 we have approximately $23.9 million in non-cancelable commitments for the purchase of software, goods and services, of which $20.1 million is due within the next 12 months. as of december 31, 2022, we had $345.6 million in outstanding debt under our 2021 credit agreement, including $3.5 million due within the next 12 months. as of december 31, 2022, cash settlement related to the customer ears is estimated to be $276.7 million. the estimated customer ear liability is included in current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet as of december 31, 2022, reflecting our expectation that the merger will close within the next 12 months, which would result in payment of the ear liabilities. the tax receivable agreement became effective in connection with the reorganization transactions in february 2021. as of december 31, 2022 , the estimated liability under the tax receivable agreement was $59.1 million, and is expected to increase as llc units are exchanged for shares of class a common stock in the future. we anticipate making payments under the tax receivable agreement during the first half of 2023, as we have finalized the 2021 corporate tax return, with payments being spread over at least a 15 year period. we are obligated as a lessee under certain non-cancellable operating leases for several office and other facility locations, with expected total cash commitments over the remaining lease terms of $38.6 million as of december 31, 2022, of which $8.3 million is due within the next 12 months. in february 2021, in connection with the ipo, the outstanding synthetic equity units were converted to synthetic common units and are eligible for a cash payment upon each vesting date based on the preceding 30-trading day average stock price of our class a common stock. as of december 31, 2022, we expect to make payments to the employee holders of the synthetic equity units of approximately $2.4 million over the next 2 years based on the 30-day average price of our class a common stock at december 31, 2022. the merger agreement contains certain termination rights, whereby we may be obligated to pay parent a termination fee. see \"--recent developments and factors affecting our results of operations --pending acquisition\". if the merger agreement were terminated in accordance with its terms, under certain specified circumstances, we would be required to pay parent a termination fee in an amount equal to $228.0 million, including if the merger agreement is terminated due to our accepting a superior proposal or due to the board changing its recommendation to our stockholders to vote to approve the merger agreement. additionally, we have entered into agreements with certain banks that provide that, upon closing of the merger, we are obligated to pay an aggregate advisory fee of approximately $78.1 million. if the merger is not consummated, we are obligated in certain circumstances to pay a breakage fee of approximately $36.5 million. customer equity appreciation rights based on the acquisition value of the pending merger and our current stock price, the value of the outstanding ear agreements exceeded the minimum value established in the ear letter agreement. as of december 31, 2022, the estimated customer ear liability was included in current liabilities, reflecting our expectation that the merger will close within the next 12 months, which would result in payment of the ear liabilities. upon closing of the merger, we expect to make full payment of the ear liability, which was approximately $276.7 million as of december 31, 2022. amendment to tax receivable agreement the tax receivable agreement became effective in connection with the reorganization transactions in february 2021. the company, cure topco and certain other parties thereto entered into a tax receivable agreement and llc agreement amendment, dated as of september 2, 2022 (the \"tra amendment\") which (i) amends (x) the tax receivable agreement among the company, cure topco and certain other parties thereto and (y) the cure topco amended llc agreement and (ii) provides for certain covenants regarding tax reporting and tax-related actions. the tra amendment provides for (i) the termination of all payments under the tra from and after the effective time of the merger agreement, (ii) the payment of any amounts due under the tra prior to the effective time (other than payments resulting from an action taken by any party to the tra after the date of the tra amendment, which will be suspended), in accordance with the terms of the tra, which payments will be paid no earlier than 185 days following the filing of the u.s. federal income tax return of the company, (iii) a prohibition on the company terminating the tra or accelerating obligations under the tra after the date of the tra amendment and (iv) the termination of the tra effective as of immediately prior to and contingent upon the occurrence of the effective time (including termination of all of the company\\'s obligations thereunder and the obligation to make any of the foregoing suspended payments). the tra amendment also includes agreements among the parties thereto regarding the preparation of tax returns and limits actions that may be taken by the company, cure topco and certain of their controlled affiliates after the effective time. the tra amendment also (i) suspends all tax distributions under the cure topco amended llc agreement from and after the effective time, and (ii) provides that from and after the effective time, no person or entity shall have any further payment or other obligation under the tra or any obligation to make or pay tax distributions under the cure topco amended llc agreement. in the event the merger agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, (i) the tra amendment will become null and void ab initio (provided that any payments suspended as described above are required to be made), (ii) the tra and the cure topco amended llc agreement will continue in full force and effect as if the tra amendment had never been executed (provided that any suspended payments as described above are required to be made), and (iii) all of the company\\'s obligations under the cure topco amended llc agreement will continue in full force and effect as if the tra amendment had never been executed. as of december 31, 2022, the estimated liability under the tax receivable agreement was $59.1 million. the foregoing description of the tra amendment does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by, the full text of the tra amendment which was filed as exhibit 99.2 to the current report on form 8-k filed by the company with the sec on september 6, 2022. off-balance sheet arrangements except for certain letters of credit entered into in the normal course of business and certain unconsolidated variable interest entities (\"vies\") related to caravan health as described in note 6, variable interest entities in the audited consolidated financial statements, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenue or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors. critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our audited consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with gaap. the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. we base these estimates on our historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. actual results experienced may vary materially and adversely from our estimates. revisions to estimates are recognized prospectively. we believe the following critical accounting policies could potentially produce materially different results if we were to change underlying assumptions, estimates or judgments. see note 2 significant accounting policies to our audited consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for a summary of our significant accounting policies. revenue recognition we recognize revenue as the control of promised services is transferred to our customers and we generate all of our revenue from contracts with customers. the amount of revenue recognized reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for these services. the measurement and recognition of revenue requires us to make certain judgments and estimates. we apply the five-step model to recognize revenue from customer contracts. the five-step model requires us to (i) identify the contract with the customer, (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (iii) determine the transaction price, including variable consideration to the extent that it is probable that a significant future reversal will not occur, (iv) allocate the transaction price to the respective performance obligations in the contract, and (v) recognize revenue when, or as, we satisfy the performance obligation. the unit of measure for revenue recognition is a performance obligation, which is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct or series of distinct goods or services to the customer. a contract\\'s transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied. our customer contracts have either (1) a single performance obligation as the promise to transfer services is not separately identifiable from other promises in the contracts and is, therefore, not distinct; (2) a series of distinct performance obligations; or (3) multiple performance obligations, most commonly due to the contract covering multiple service offerings. for contracts with multiple performance obligations, the contract\\'s transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation on the basis of the relative standalone selling price of each distinct service in the contract. revenue generated from ihes relates to the assessments performed either within the patient\\'s home, virtually or at a healthcare provider facility as well as certain in-home clinical evaluations performed by our mobile network of providers. revenue is recognized when the ihes are submitted to our customers on a daily basis. submission to the customer occurs after the ihes are completed and coded, a process which may take one to several days after completion of the evaluation. the pricing for the ihes is generally based on a fixed transaction fee, which is directly linked to the usage of the service by the customer during a distinct service period. customers are invoiced for evaluations performed each month and remit payment accordingly. each ihe represents a single performance obligation for which revenue is recognized at a point in time when control is transferred to the customer upon submission of the completed and coded evaluation. evaluations revenue also includes revenue related to diagnostic and preventative services we provide. revenue from these services is primarily based on a fixed fee for such services and is recognized over time as the performance obligations are satisfied. therefore, this revenue does not require significant estimates and assumptions by management. the transaction price for certain of our ihes is reduced by the grant date fair value of outstanding customer ears. see \"--critical accounting policies--customer equity appreciation rights.\" revenue generated from value-based care services primarily consists of revenue generated by our caravan health subsidiary through the provision of aco enablement services, caravan health has multiple product and service offerings for customers around the management of the aco model. these include, but are not limited to, population health software, analytics, practice improvement, compliance, and governance. the overall objective of the services provided is to help the customer receive shared savings from cms. caravan health enters into arrangements with customers wherein we receive a contracted percentage of each customer\\'s portion of shared savings if earned. we recognize shared savings revenue as performance obligations are satisfied over time, commensurate with the recurring aco services provided to the customer over a 12-month calendar year period. the shared savings transaction price is variable, and therefore, we estimate an amount we expect to receive for each 12-month calendar year performance obligation period. in order to estimate this variable consideration, management initially uses estimates of historical performance of the acos. we consider inputs such as attributed patients, expenditures, benchmarks and inflation factors. we adjust our estimates at the end of each reporting period to the extent new information indicates a change is needed. we apply a constraint to the variable consideration estimate in circumstances where we believe the data received is incomplete or inconsistent, so as not to have the estimates result in a significant revenue reversal in future periods. although our estimates are based on the information available to us at each reporting date, new and material information may cause actual revenue earned to differ from the estimates recorded each period. these include, among others, hierarchical conditional category (\"hcc\") coding information, quarterly reports from cms with information on the aforementioned inputs, unexpected changes in attributed patients and other limitations of the program beyond our control. we receive final reconciliations from cms and collect the cash related to shared savings earned annually in the third or fourth quarter of each year for the preceding calendar year. the remaining sources of aco enablement services revenue are recognized over time when, or as, the performance obligations are satisfied and are primarily based on a fixed fee or per member per month fee. therefore, they do not require significant estimates and assumptions by management. see note 7 revenue recognition to our audited consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for further details regarding our revenue recognition policies. allowance for doubtful accounts we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers. we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based on the best facts available to us. we consider historical realization data, accounts receivable aging trends and other operational trends to estimate the collectability of receivables. after all reasonable attempts are made to collect a receivable, the receivable is written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts. as of december 31, 2022, we had an allowance for doubtful accounts of $8.8 million, which represented 5.6% of total accounts receivable, net. we continue to assess our receivable portfolio and collections in light of the current economic environment and its impact on our estimation of the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts. equity-based compensation we recognize equity-based compensation for all equity-based awards granted to employees based on the grant date fair value of the award. the resulting compensation expense is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. forfeitures are recognized as they occur. following our ipo in february 2021, equity awards have been issued to certain employees and our board in the form of rsus and/or stock options. rsus are subject to time-based vesting and vest either on the one-year anniversary of the grant date or ratably over four years. the grant date fair value of rsus is based on the closing stock price of our class a common stock on the date of grant and is recognized as equity-based compensation expense over the vesting period. stock options are subject to time-based vesting and vest ratably over three or four years. the grant date fair value of stock options is measured using a black-scholes model and is recognized as equity-based compensation expense over the vesting period. inputs to the black-scholes model include the closing stock price of our class a common stock on date of grant, as well as assumptions for expected term, expected volatility, expected dividend yield and risk-free interest rate. the expected term of the option represents the period the stock-based awards are expected to be outstanding. we use the simplified method for estimating the expected term of the options since we have limited historical experience to estimate expected term behavior. since our class a common shares were not publicly traded until february 2021 and were rarely traded privately, at the time of each grant, there has been insufficient volatility data available. accordingly, we calculate expected volatility using comparable peer companies with publicly traded shares over a term similar to the expected term of the options issued. we do not intend to pay dividends on our common shares, therefore, the dividend yield percentage is zero. the risk-free interest rate is based on the u.s. treasury constant maturity interest rate whose term is consistent with the expected life of our stock options. we used the weighted average assumptions to estimate the fair value of stock options granted for the periods presented as follows. ##table_start year ended december 31, 2022 december 31, 2021 expected term (years) 6.25 6.10 expected volatility 55.3 % 51.6 % expected dividend yield -- -- weighted average risk-free interest rate 1.90 % 0.80 % weighted average grant date fair value $ 7.75 $ 11.95 ##table_end equity-based compensation prior to the ipo included awards that were profits interest units for federal income tax purposes. the profits interest units had time-based and performance-based vesting criteria. awards with time-based vesting generally vest over time, with a portion of the awards vesting on the grant date anniversary and other awards vesting on december 31 of each year. in connection with the ipo, the profits interest units were reclassified into common units and remain subject to the same time-based and performance-based vesting criteria as per the terms of the original awards. the grant date fair value of the profits interests was measured using a monte carlo option pricing model and is being recognized for awards subject to time-based vesting as equity-based compensation expense over the requisite service period. for those awards with performance-based vesting, the total cash on cash return of the private equity owners as defined in the award agreement must exceed certain multiples set forth in the award agreement in order to vest, and is also generally dependent upon the participant\\'s continued employment. the criteria associated with the performance-vesting criteria has not been probable to date. as such, we have not recorded any equity-based compensation expense related to the equity-based awards that are subject to performance-based vesting criteria only. in march 2022, 3,572,469 then outstanding incentive units subject to performance-based vesting criteria were amended to add an alternative two-year service-vesting condition to the performance-vesting criteria, which, through the effective date of the amendment, were considered not probable of occurring and therefore we had not previously recorded any expense related to these awards. the amended equity awards will now vest based on the satisfaction of the earlier to occur of 1) a two year service condition, with 50% vesting in each of march 2023 and march 2024 or 2) the achievement of the original performance vesting criteria. as a result of this amendment, which resulted in vesting that is considered probable of occurring, we began to record equity-based compensation expense for these amended equity awards in march 2022. the equity-based compensation expense related to these amended awards is based on the fair value as of the effective date of the amended equity awards and will be recorded over the two year service period. the total equity value of cure topco at the time of grant represented a key input for determining the fair value of the underlying common units. prior to the ipo, a discount for lack of marketability was applied to the per unit fair value to reflect increased risk arising from the inability to readily sell our common units. in order to estimate the fair value of our common units prior to the ipo, we used a combination of the market approach and the income approach. we used a combination of these standard valuation techniques rather than picking just one overall approach, as we believe that the market approach on its own provides a less reliable evaluation of the fair value than an income approach because such an approach relies solely on data and trends of companies in similar market segments with similar characteristics. by contrast, the income approach incorporates management\\'s best estimates of future performance based on both company and industry-specific factors and incorporates management\\'s long-term strategy for positioning and operating the business. for the market approach, we utilized the guideline company method by selecting certain companies that we considered to be the most comparable to us in terms of size, growth, profitability, risk and return on investment, among others. we then used these guideline companies to develop relevant market multiples and ratios. the market multiples and ratios were applied to our financial projections based on assumptions at the time of the valuation in order to estimate our total enterprise value. since there is not an active market for our common units, a discount for lack of marketability was then applied to the resulting value. for the income approach, we performed discounted cash flow analyses utilizing projected cash flows, which were discounted to the present value in order to arrive at an enterprise value. the key assumptions used in the income approach include management\\'s financial projections which are based on highly subjective assumptions as of the date of valuation, a discount rate, and a long-term growth rate. the monte carlo simulation also requires additional inputs to estimate the grant date fair value of an award, including an assumption for expected volatility, expected dividend yield, risk-free rate and an expected life. since we were historically privately held, we calculated expected volatility using comparable peer companies with publicly traded shares over a term similar to the expected term of the underlying award. at the time of grant, we had no intention to pay dividends on our common units, and therefore, the dividend yield percentage was zero. the risk- free interest rate was based on the u.s. treasury constant maturity interest rate whose term is consistent with the expected life of the profits interests. profits interest awards granted during the year ended december 31, 2020 included the following weighted average assumptions (annualized percentages): ##table_start december 31, 2020 expected volatility 41.6 % expected dividend yield -- risk-free interest rate 1.3 % expected life (years) 2.90 ##table_end in addition, remedy partners historically maintained an equity incentive plan whereby certain employees and directors were granted stock options. in november 2019, at the conclusion of the remedy partners acquisition, outstanding remedy partners stock options were converted to stock options in new remedy corp. no additional stock option grants were made following the remedy partners acquisition until the 2021 ltip was adopted in connection with our ipo. in connection with the ipo, these former stock options in new remedy corp. were converted into stock options in signify health, inc. the conversion of the outstanding stock options did not result in any incremental expense as the number of stock options outstanding and the exercise price were both adjusted on a proportionate basis, and therefore, the fair value of the new award did not exceed the fair value of the previous award immediately prior to the modification. except as described below with respect to the amended stock options,the outstanding stock options remain subject to their original vesting schedules and contractual terms. accordingly, for those stock options we continue to recognize the original grant date fair value of these converted stock options. the original grant date fair value of the outstanding stock options was estimated using a black-scholes option-pricing model, which required the input of subjective assumptions, including estimated share price, volatility over the expected term of the awards, expected term, risk free interest rate and expected dividends, as described above. expected volatility, expected dividend yield and risk-free interest rate were all calculated in similar ways for the remedy partners stock options as described above for the valuation of the profits interests. the expected term of the stock options represents the period the stock options were expected to be outstanding. we used the simplified method for estimating the expected term of the stock options. as noted above, on march 1, 2022 our board approved amendments to certain outstanding equity awards subject to performance-based vesting criteria. the equity awards were amended with an effective date of march 7, 2022, and included 817,081 then outstanding stock options (which were originally granted by remedy partners). the amendments added an alternative two-year service-vesting condition to the performance-vesting criteria, which, through the effective date of the amendment, were considered not probable of occurring and therefore we had not previously recorded any expense related to these awards. the amended equity awards will now vest based on the satisfaction of the earlier to occur of (1) a two year service condition, with 50% vesting in each of march 2023 and march 2024 or (2) the achievement of the original performance vesting criteria. as a result of this amendment, which results in vesting that is considered probable of occurring, we began to record equity-based compensation expense for these amended equity awards in march 2022. the equity-based compensation expense related to these amended awards is based on the black-scholes value as of the effective date of the amended equity awards, which was calculated as described above, and will be recorded over the two year service period. we continue to record equity-based compensation expense related to the converted remedy partners stock options that remain outstanding over the remaining vesting periods, to the extent the former remedy partners employees who received the stock option grants remain our employees. customer equity appreciation rights in december 2019 and september 2020, we entered into ear agreements with one of our customers. on december 31, 2021, we entered into amendments of the 2019 and 2020 ear agreements, as well as the ear letter agreement. see \"--liquidity and capital resources--customer equity appreciation rights agreements.\" the initial grant date fair values of the ears were each estimated in a similar manner, subject to the same management assumptions, as described for equity-based compensation as the ears are a form of equity-based award. however, since the ears are granted to a customer, they are also subject to accounting guidance for revenue recognition. accordingly, their initial grant date fair values are recorded as a reduction to the transaction price over the service period for the associated customer\\'s ihe services. estimated changes in fair market value are recorded each accounting period based on management\\'s current assumptions related to the underlying valuation approaches. these changes in fair market value are recorded in other expense (income), net on the consolidated statement of operations. the methodology for measuring the fair value of the customer equity appreciation rights and the ear letter agreement was changed from an option pricing model to a discounted time value model as of december 31, 2022 as a result of the pending merger, see note 3 pending acquisition to our audited consolidated financial statements included in item 8 to this annual report on form 10-k. the key assumptions in the valuation are the time to liquidity, which is estimated to be between three and five months based on the expected timing of the regulatory approvals of the transaction, and the annualized cost of debt discount rate, which we estimate to be 5.5% as of december 31, 2022. based on the current equity value, the estimated fair value of the customer equity appreciation rights significantly exceeds the minimum value established in the ear letter agreement, resulting in a de minimis value for the ear letter agreement as of december 31, 2022. as of december 31, 2022, the full value of the ears have been earned and no forfeitures have occurred. due to the change in control and liquidity provisions of each outstanding customer equity appreciation right, the customer ear liabilities are classified as a current liability as cash settlement of the customer equity appreciation rights is expected to occur following the close of the pending merger. business combinations we account for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting, which requires the acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize the fair value of all assets acquired, liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree, and establishes the acquisition date as the fair value measurement point. accordingly, we recognize assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations, including contingent assets and liabilities and noncontrolling interests in the acquiree, based on fair value estimates as of the date of acquisition. discounted cash flow models are typically used in these valuations if quoted market prices are not available, and the models require the use of significant estimates and assumptions including, but not limited to (1) estimating future revenue, expenses and cash flows expected to be collected; and (2) developing appropriate discount rates, long-term growth rates and probability rates. our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but we recognize that the assumptions are inherently uncertain. we recognize and measure goodwill, if any, as of the acquisition date, as the excess of the fair value of the consideration paid over the fair value of the identified net assets acquired. the primary drivers that generate goodwill are the value of synergies with our existing operations, ability to grow in the market, and estimates of market share at the date of purchase. goodwill recorded in an acquisition is assigned to applicable reporting units based on expected revenues or expected cash flows. identifiable intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their useful lives. acquisition-related contingent consideration is initially measured and recorded at its estimated fair value as an element of consideration paid in connection with an acquisition. subsequent adjustments are recognized in sg&a expense in the consolidated statements of operations. we determine the initial fair value of acquisition-related contingent consideration, and any subsequent changes in fair value using a discounted probability weighted approach or a black-scholes option pricing model depending on the nature and terms of the contingent consideration. both of these valuation approaches take into consideration certain unobservable inputs. the unobservable inputs include long-term financial forecasts, expected term until payout, volatility, discount rate, credit spread, and risk-free rate. the expected volatility and discount rate were calculated using comparable peer companies, adjusted, if needed for the acquired company\\'s operational leverage. the risk-free interest rate is based on the u.s. treasury rates that are commensurate with the term of the contingent consideration. the contingent consideration related to the caravan health acquisition is payable based on the achievement of certain performance criteria, one of which is revenue. both performance criteria must be achieved for any payment to be due. as of december 31, 2022, the estimated fair value of contingent consideration decreased since the acquisition date as the estimated revenue for 2022 is below the threshold to earn any of the payment and therefore the likelihood of the defined revenue criteria being achieved is unlikely, see note 14 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for further information. while caravan revenue for 2022 will not be deemed final until receipt of the final reconciliation from cms in the second half of 2023, the performance period to earn the payment ended as of december 31, 2022. therefore, no valuation technique was used, and based on observable inputs, the value of the contingent consideration is estimated to be zero as of december 31, 2022. recoverability of goodwill, intangible assets, and other long-lived assets subject to amortization goodwill is an asset which represents the future economic benefits which arise from the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of acquired net assets in a business combination, including the amount assigned to identifiable intangible assets. goodwill is not amortized, but rather is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently whenever there are triggering events or changes in circumstances which indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable and an impairment loss may have been incurred. as of december 31, 2022, we had goodwill of approximately $369.9 million, which represented 21.2% of our consolidated total assets. as of december 31, 2021, we had goodwill of approximately $170.4 million, which represented 8.0% of our consolidated total assets. we assess goodwill for impairment at least annually, during the fourth quarter, and more frequently if indicators of impairment exist. impairment testing for goodwill is performed at the reporting unit level. a reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available, and management regularly reviews the operating results of that component. as of december 31, 2022, we have a single reporting unit. we perform an assessment of goodwill utilizing either a qualitative or quantitative impairment test. the qualitative impairment test assesses several factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. if management concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, a quantitative fair value test is performed. in a quantitative impairment test, management assesses goodwill by comparing the carrying amount of each reporting unit to its fair value. we estimate the fair value of each of our reporting units using either an income approach, a market valuation approach, a transaction valuation approach or a blended approach. if the fair value exceeds the carrying value of a reporting unit, goodwill is not considered impaired. if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, goodwill is considered impaired and we would recognize an impairment loss equal to the excess of a reporting unit\\'s carrying amount over its fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. we perform discounted cash flow analyses which utilize projected cash flows as well as a residual value, which is discounted to the present value in order to arrive at a reporting unit fair value. the determination of whether or not goodwill has become impaired involves a significant level of judgment in the assumptions and estimates underlying the approach used to determine the value of our reporting units. actual results could differ from management\\'s estimates, and such differences could be material to our consolidated financial position and results of operations. see \"item 1a. risk factors.\" given the significant cushion between the fair value and carrying value in the prior year, we performed a qualitative assessment in 2022 for goodwill and concluded that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the remaining reporting unit is greater than its carrying value amount. we review the carrying value of other long-lived assets or groups of assets, including property and equipment, internally developed software costs and other intangible assets, to be used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization include customer relationships, acquired and capitalized software, and trade names. acquired intangible assets are initially recorded at fair value and are amortized on a basis consistent with the timing and pattern of expected cash flows used to value the intangible asset, generally on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life. capitalized software is recorded for certain costs incurred for the development of internal-use software. these costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the expected economic life of the software. we assess the recoverability of an asset or group of assets by determining whether the carrying value of the asset or group of assets exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets over the remaining economic life of the asset or the primary asset in the group of assets. if such testing indicates the carrying value of the asset or group of assets is not recoverable, we estimate the fair value of the asset or group of assets using various valuation methodologies, including discounted cash flow models and quoted market values, as necessary. if the fair value of those assets or groups of assets is less than carrying value, we record an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value. during the year ended december 31, 2022, we recorded an asset impairment charge of $3.3 million as a result of the decision to end our community service offering. we recorded an asset impairment of $0.8 million related to certain capitalized software during the year ended december 31, 2020 as a result of the discontinued use of certain software. income taxes we are organized as a c corporation and own a controlling interest in cure topco which is organized as a partnership for tax purposes. in addition, cure topco wholly owns c corporations, and other c corporations are consolidated for gaap purposes pursuant to the variable interest entity rules. for partnership and disregarded entities, taxable income and the resulting liabilities are allocated among the owners of the entities and reported on the tax filings for those owners. we record income tax (benefit) expense, deferred tax assets, and deferred tax liabilities only for the items for which we are responsible for making payments directly to the relevant tax authority. in evaluating the company\\'s ability to realize its deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized and, when necessary, a valuation allowance is established. management also considers the projected reversal of deferred tax liabilities and projected future taxable income in making this assessment. based upon this assessment, management believes it is more likely than not that the company will realize the benefits of these deductible differences, net of valuation allowance. recent accounting pronouncements below is a description of certain recent accounting pronouncements that have had or may have an impact on our financial statements. see note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for further information. in february 2016, the fasb issued asu 2016-02, leases (\"asc 842\") which requires lessees to recognize leases on the balance sheet by recording a right-of-use asset and lease liability. this guidance was effective for non-public entities (as well as public entities that were emerging growth companies, like us) for annual reporting period s beginning after december 15, 2021. we adopted this new guidance as of january 1, 2022 and applied the transition option, whereby prior comparative periods are not retrospectively presented in the consolidated financial statements. we elected the package of practical expedients not to reassess prior conclusions related to contracts containing leases, lease classification and initial direct costs and the lessee practical expedient to combine lease and non-lease components for all asset classes. we made a policy election to not recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases for all asset classes. see note 9 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for further information. in october 2021, the fasb issued asu 2021-08, business combinations (topic 805) accounting for contract assets and contract liabilities from contracts with customers (\"asu 2021-08\") which requires that an entity (acquirer) recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination in accordance with topic 606. asu 2021-08 is effective for public entities for fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years, and should be applied prospectively to business combinations occurring on or after the effective date of the amendments. we elected to early adopt this new guidance for interim periods in 2022 beginning with the caravan health acquisition on march 1, 2022. we measured the acquired contract assets and liabilities in accordance with topic 606. see note 5 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for further information. in november 2021, the fasb issued asu 2021-10, government assistance (topic 832) disclosures by business entities about government assistance (\"asu 2021-10\") which requires annual disclosures that increase the transparency of transactions with a government accounted for by applying a grant or contribution accounting model, including (1) the types of transactions, (2) the accounting for those transactions, and (3) the effect of those transactions on an entity\\'s financial statements. asu 2021-10 was effective for all entities for fiscal years beginning after december 31, 2021. we adopted this new guidance as of january 1, 2022. see note 21 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for further information. in june 2016, the fasb issued asu 2016-13, financial instruments - credit losses (topic 326) (\"asu 2016-13\") which introduced the current expected credit losses methodology for estimating allowances for credit losses. asu 2016-13 applies to all financial instruments carried at amortized cost and off-balance-sheet credit exposures not accounted for as insurance, including loan commitments, standby letters of credit, and financial guarantees. the new accounting standard does not apply to trading assets, loans held for sale, financial assets for which the fair value option has been elected, or loans and receivables between entities under common control. asu 2016-13 is effective for non-public entities (as well as public entities that were emerging growth companies, like us) for fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years. we will adopt this guidance as of january 1, 2023 with no significant impact to our financial statements.',\n",

change in the political or governmental policies, labor shortages, unplanned maintenance or other manufacturing problems; and * other risks, uncertainties, and assumptions identified in item 1a, \"risk factors,\" of this annual report on form 10-k and risks, uncertainties, and assumptions reflected in other documents we file with the sec. cost of goods sold cost of goods sold includes manufacturing costs for our semiconductors and our wafers. these costs include raw materials used in our manufacturing processes as well as labor costs and overhead expenses. cost of goods sold is also impacted by yield improvements, capacity utilization and manufacturing efficiencies. in addition, cost of goods sold includes the cost of products that we purchase from other manufacturers and sell to our customers. cost of goods sold is also affected by inventory obsolescence if our inventory management is not efficient. selling, general and administrative selling, general and administrative expenses relate primarily to compensation and associated expenses for personnel in general management, sales and marketing, information technology, engineering, human resources, procurement, planning and finance, and sales commissions, as well as outside legal, investor relations, accounting, consulting and other operating expenses. also included in selling, general and administrative expenses are acquisition costs from business combinations. research and development research and development expenses consist of compensation and associated costs of employees engaged in research and development projects, as well as materials and equipment used for new product development and technology qualification. research and development expenses are executed on a global basis and are primarily associated with where the engineering talent is located, as well as the location of manufacturing sites participating in any required technology or process development. all research and development expenses are expensed as incurred. amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets consists of assets such as developed technologies and customer relationships. interest income / expense interest income consists of interest earned on our cash and investment balances. interest expense consists of interest payable on our outstanding credit facilities and other debt instruments. foreign currency (loss) gain, net this income account is used to show the amount gained or lost as a result of foreign currency transactions. unrealized (loss) gain on investments we hold investments in the form of common stock or some other similar equivalent accounted for under fair-value accounting. this account is used to show the necessary mark-to-market adjustments. income tax provision our global presence requires us to pay income taxes in a number of jurisdictions. see note 12 of \"notes to consolidated financial statements\" for additional information. net income attributable to noncontrolling interest this represents the minority investors\\' share of our subsidiaries\\' earnings. net income attributable to common stockholders net income attributable to common stockholders is net income less net income attributable to noncontrolling interest. results of operations the following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, the percentage that certain items in the statements of income bear to net sales: ##table_start percent of net sales twelve months ended december 31, net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % cost of goods sold (58.7 ) (62.9 ) gross profit 41.3 37.1 operating expenses (21.0 ) (21.8 ) income from operations 20.4 15.3 interest income 0.2 0.2 interest expense (0.4 ) (0.4 ) foreign currency gain

year, due primarily to our content expansion initiatives and improvements in product mix. the company has experienced growth in higher-margin end markets which have enabled the company to increase its net sales and margins, even in the midst of the current supply-constrained environment. for the twelve months ended december 31, 2022, weighted-average sales price of the company\\'s products increased 28.5% when compared to the prior year. this represents the improved product mix across the portfolio, as well as price increases to offset supply chain cost increasing. the table below sets forth our revenue as a percentage of product revenue by end-user market: ##table_start twelve months ended december 31, end-markets industrial 27% 23% 23% automotive 15% 12% 11% computing 24% 30% 20% communications 15% 16% 21% consumer 19% 19% 25% ##table_end cost of goods sold cost of goods sold increased approximately $38.5 million for the twelve months ended december 31, 2022 compared to the same period last year. as a percent of sales, cost of goods sold was 58.7% for the twelve months ended december 31, 2022, compared to 62.9% for the same period last year. average unit cost increased 19.9% for the twelve months ended december 31, 2022, compared to the same period last year, due to cost increases from various subcontractors and foundries, as well as the cost for a more premium mix of products that were sold in 2022. for the twelve months ended december 31, 2022, gross profit increased approximately 23.4% when compared to the prior year. gross profit margin for the twelve month periods ended december 31, 2022 and 2021, was 41.3% and 37.1%, respectively. operating expenses operating expenses for the twelve months ended december 31, 2022 increased approximately $24.7 million, or 6.3%, compared to the same period last year. selling, general and administrative expenses (\"sg&a\") increased approximately $23.2 million. the increase in sg&a was driven by increases in wages and benefits, selling expenses and freight and duty charges. research and development expenses (\"r&d\") increased approximately $7.1 million primarily due to increases in wages and benefits, and costs associated with new product and new process development activities. amortization of acquisition-related intangibles decreased approximately 4.0% reflecting the overall reduction in the balance of intangible assets subject to amortization. sg&a, as a percentage of sales, was 14.0% and 14.3% for the twelve-month periods ended december 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. r&d, as a percentage of sales, was 6.3% and 6.6% for the twelve-month periods ended december 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. other (expense)/income interest income was relatively flat when compared to 2021. the increase in interest expense is due to increased interest rates on our floating rate debt partially offset by lower borrowing levels. foreign currency gain increased $4.2 million during the twelve months ended december 31, 2022 due to the effectiveness of the company\\'s hedging program. unrealized loss on investments increased from 2021 due to investment losses from investments the company acquired in the lsc acquisition. income tax provision we recognized income tax expense of approximately $56.7 million for the twelve months ended december 31, 2022, and income tax expense of approximately $78.8 million for the twelve months ended december 31, 2021, resulting in effective income tax rates of 14.3% and 25.0%, respectively. the decrease in the effective tax rate for 2022 compared to 2021 is primarily attributable to an increase in overall pre-tax book income and the impact of changes to the outside basis difference in foreign subsidiaries where the company does not assert permanent reinvestment. our undistributed foreign earnings continue to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations, with limited exceptions related to earnings of european and asian subsidiaries. any future distributions of foreign earnings will not be subject to additional u.s. income tax but may be subject to foreign withholding taxes. the company has recorded outside basis differences in the limited instances where they do not assert permanent reinvestment. as of december 31, 2022, our foreign subsidiaries held approximately $296.8 million of cash, cash equivalents and investments of which approximately $68.0 million would be subject to foreign withholding tax if distributed outside the country in which the related earnings were generated. financial condition liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, funds from operations and, if necessary, borrowings under our credit facilities. liquidity requirements our primary liquidity requirements have been to meet our capital expenditure needs and to fund ongoing operations. for 2022 and 2021 our working capital was $729.1 million and $716.6 million, respectively. in 2022, our working capital increased primarily due to increases in accounts receivable and inventories, and decrease in our accounts payable and the current portion of long-term debt. we expect cash generated by our operations together with existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and available credit facilities to be sufficient to satisfy our working capital needs, capital asset purchases, outstanding commitments and other liquidity requirements associated with our existing operations for at least the next 12 months. short-term investments as of december 31, 2022, we had short-term investments of approximately $7.1 million. these investments are highly liquid with maturity dates greater than three months at the date of purchase. we generally can access these investments in a relatively short amount of time but in doing so we generally forfeit a portion of interest income. short-term debt our asia subsidiaries maintain credit facilities with several financial institutions through our foreign entities worldwide totaling $172.8 million. other than two taiwanese credit facilities that are collateralized by assets, our foreign credit lines are unsecured, uncommitted and contain no restrictive covenants. these credit facilities bear interest at libor or similar indices plus a specified margin. interest payments are due monthly on outstanding amounts under the credit lines. the unused and available credit under the various facilities as of december 31, 2022, was approximately $136.0 million, net of $36.3 million advanced under our foreign credit lines and $0.4 million credit used for import and export guarantee. long-term debt the company maintains a long-term credit facility (\"u.s. credit agreement\") consisting of a term loan with a current balance of zero and a $200.0 million revolving senior credit facility with zero drawn as of december 31, 2022. the revolving senior credit facility and term loan mature on may 29, 2024. both the term loan portion and the revolving portion of the credit agreement bear an interest rate at libor or similar other indices plus a specified margin. the credit agreement contains certain financial and non-financial covenants, including, but not limited to, a maximum consolidated leverage ratio, a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio, and restrictions on liens, indebtedness, investments, fundamental changes, dispositions, and restricted payments (including dividends and share repurchases). furthermore, under the credit agreement, restricted payments, including dividends and share repurchases, are permitted in certain circumstances, including while the pro forma consolidated leverage ratio is, both before and after giving effect to any such restricted payment, at least 0.25 to 1.00 less than the maximum permitted under the credit agreement. in addition to the liquidity provided by the u.s. credit agreement, our 51% owned subsidiary, eris technology company (\"eris\"), borrowed $25.8 million on a long-term basis from local taiwan banks. the eris debt matures in periods through 2033. diodes hong kong limited, a company incorporated under the laws of hong kong and a subsidiary of the company, has a us dollar revolving loan facility in an aggregate amount equal to $105.0 million (the \"facility\"). diodes hong kong limited used a portion of the proceeds for the facility (i) to refinance certain existing indebtedness and (ii) to finance working capital requirements and its general corporate purposes. in addition, on january 22, 2021, diodes hong kong limited entered into a hong kong debenture (the \"debenture\") with the hongkong and shanghai banking corporation limited, as security agent (the \"security agent\"). pursuant to the debenture, diodes hong kong limited granted to the security agent, on behalf of itself and the other secured parties, a security interest over certain assets of diodes hong kong limited. the security interest is continuing security for the payment, discharge and performance of all of the secured liabilities, which includes diodes hong kong limited\\'s payment obligations under the facility. the facility is governed by the laws of hong kong. capital expenditures and investments in 2022 and 2021, our total cash capital expenditures were approximately $211.7 million and $141.2 million, respectively. our capital expenditures for these periods were primarily related to manufacturing expansion in both our assembly/test and wafer fabrication facilities. cash capital expenditures in 2022 were approximately 10.6% of our net sales. the company\\'s 2022 capital expenditures were higher than our target model of 5% to 9% of net sales, due to expansion of our wafer fabrication facility in hsinchu science park in taiwan. going forward, over the long term, the company expects capital expenditures to be within the 5% to 9% of net sales target model range. the company\\'s restricted cash primarily consisted of the cash required to be on deposit under contractual agreements with banks to support outstanding loan and import/export guarantees. as of december 31, 2022, restricted cash of $4.4 million was pledged as collateral for issuance of bank loans, bank acceptance notes and letters of credit. our foreign operations expose us to unique intellectual property technology and other risks compared to a company with fewer or no international operations. for example, we are exposed to potential cyber security breaches that may target our employees or infrastructure outside the united states. these risks may result in material and adverse impacts on our financial condition and results of operations. see \"risk factors - risks related to our international operations\" in part i, item 1a of this annual report for a more detailed summary of the intellectual property technology risks and other associated with our international business operations. discussion of cash flows cash and cash equivalents, including restricted cash, decreased approximately $25.7 million to $341.1 million in 2022 from $366.8 million in 2021. the table below sets forth summary information from our statements of cash flows: ##table_start twelve months ended december 31, net cash flows provided by operating activities $ 392,501 $ 338,543 net cash and cash equivalents used in investing activities (265,263 ) (144,229 ) net cash and cash equivalents used in financing activities (125,713 ) (158,441 ) effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (27,244 ) 10,416 change in cash and cash equivalents, including restricted cash $ (25,719 ) $ 46,289 ##table_end operating activities net cash provided by operating activities for 2022 was approximately $392.5 million, due primarily to $339.3 million of net income, $127.8 million in depreciation expense and amortization of intangible assets expense and $36.3 million from non-cash share-based compensation expense and a non-cash loss on investments of $16.2 million. these increases were partially offset by a net decrease in operating capital assets and liabilities of $81.1 million, a decrease in deferred income taxes of $39.2 million. investing activities net cash used in investing activities for 2022 was approximately $265.3 million, due primarily to the purchase of property, plant and equipment for $211.7 million and the purchase of spfab for $80.4 million. financing activities net cash used in financing activities for 2022 was approximately $125.7 million, due primarily to the net reduction in our outstanding indebtedness of $112.2 million and taxes on net share settlements of $12.3 million. debt instruments the u.s. credit facility contains certain financial and non-financial covenants, including, but not limited to, a maximum consolidated leverage ratio, a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio, and restrictions on liens, indebtedness, investments, fundamental changes, dispositions, and restricted payments (including dividends and share repurchases). as of december 31, 2022, our asia subsidiaries had unused and available credit lines of up to an aggregate of approximately $136.0 million, with several financial institutions. our foreign credit lines are unsecured and uncommitted, except for two taiwanese credit facilities that are collateralized by assets. our foreign credit lines bear interest at libor or similar indices plus a specified margin. at december 31, 2022, $36.3 million was outstanding under these lines of credit. in addition to our credit lines, our 51% owned subsidiary, eris technology corporation (\"eris\"), had long-term debt of $25.8 million, at december 31, 2022, from local taiwan banks. the outstanding eris debt matures in various periods from 2024 through 2033. see \"liquidity and capital resources\" above and note 8 of \"notes to consolidated financial statements\" of this annual report for additional information. diodes hong kong limited, a company incorporated under the laws of hong kong and a subsidiary of the company, has a us dollar revolving loan facility in an aggregate amount equal to $105.0 million (the \"facility\"). diodes hong kong limited used a portion of the proceeds of the facility (i) to refinance certain existing indebtedness and (ii) to finance working capital requirements and its general corporate purposes. in addition, on january 22, 2021, diodes hong kong limited entered into a hong kong debenture (the \"debenture\") with the hongkong and shanghai banking corporation limited, as security agent (the \"security agent\"). pursuant to the debenture, diodes hong kong limited granted to the security agent, on behalf of itself and the other secured parties, a security interest over certain assets of diodes hong kong limited. the security interest is continuing security for the payment, discharge and performance of all of the secured liabilities, which includes diodes hong kong limited\\'s payment obligations under the facility. the facility is governed by the laws of hong kong. contractual obligations our estimated future obligations consist of debt, interest on long-term debt, leases, defined benefit obligation and purchase obligations. see note 8 \"bank credit agreements and other short-term and long-term debt, note 9 - \"leases\", note 13 - \"employee benefit plans\" and note 17 - \"commitments and contingencies\" of the notes to consolidated financial statements\" included elsewhere in this annual report for additional information. we cannot make reasonable estimates of the amount and period in which our tax liabilities will be paid. see \"accounting for income taxes\" below and note 12 of \"notes to consolidated financial statements\" of this annual report for additional information. critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted principles in the united states of america (\"u.s. gaap\") requires that management make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reporting period. on an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, which are based upon historical experiences, market trends and financial forecasts and projections, and upon various assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances at that certain point in time. actual results may differ, significantly at times, from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. we believe the following critical accounting estimates affect the significant estimates and judgments we use in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, and may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity than others. revenue recognition in relation to our revenue recognition, we record estimated allowances/reserves for the following items; * ship and debit reserves, which arise when we, from time to time based on market conditions, issue credit to certain distributors upon their shipments to their end customers; * stock rotation reserves, which are contractual obligations that permit certain distributors, up to four times a year, to return a portion of their inventory based on historical shipments to them in exchange for an equal and offsetting order; * price protection reserves, which arise when market conditions cause average selling prices to decrease and we issue credit to certain distributors on their inventory; * accounts receivable reserves related to our customer\\'s ability to pay; and * product returns, distributor price adjustments and other allowances. our reserve estimates are based upon historical data as well as projections of sales, distributor inventories, price adjustments, average selling prices and market conditions. actual returns and adjustments could be significantly different from our estimates and provisions, resulting in an adjustment to net sales. inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. cost is determined principally by the first-in, first-out method. on an ongoing basis, we evaluate our inventory for obsolescence and slow-moving items. this evaluation includes analysis of sales levels, sales projections, and purchases by item, as well as raw material usage related to our manufacturing facilities. if our review indicates a reduction in utility below carrying value, we reduce our inventory to a new cost basis. if future demand or market conditions are different than our current estimates, an inventory adjustment may be required, and would be reflected in cost of goods sold in the period the revision is made. accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate. this process involves using an asset and liability approach whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for differences in the financial reporting bases and tax bases of our assets and liabilities. a valuation allowance is provided against deferred tax assets unless it is more likely than not that such deferred tax assets will be realized. this analysis requires considerable judgment and is subject to change to reflect future events and changes in the tax laws. the benefit of a tax position is recognized only if it is more likely than not that the tax position would be sustained based on its technical merits in a tax examination, using the presumption the tax authority has full knowledge of all relevant facts regarding the position. the amount of benefit recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized on ultimate settlement with the tax authority. for tax positions not meeting the more likely than not test, no tax benefit is recorded. goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets goodwill and other indefinite lived assets are tested for impairment on an annual basis or when an event or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying value may not be recoverable. goodwill impairment is tested at the reporting unit level, which is defined as an operating segment or one level below the operating segment. we have one operating segment. goodwill is reviewed for impairment using either a qualitative assessment or a quantitative goodwill impairment test. if we choose to perform a qualitative assessment and determine the fair value more likely than not exceeds the carrying value, no further evaluation is necessary. when we perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test, we compare fair value to carrying value, which includes goodwill. if fair value of exceeds carrying value, the goodwill is not considered impaired. if the carrying value is higher than the fair value, the difference would be recognized as an impairment loss. we determine the fair value of our reporting units based on an income approach, whereby the fair value of the reporting unit is derived from the present value of estimated future cash flows. the assumptions about estimated cash flows include factors such as future revenue, gross profit, operating expenses, and industry trends. we consider historical rates and current market conditions when determining the discount and long-term growth rates to use in its analysis. we consider other valuation methods, such as the cost approach or market approach, if it is determined that these methods provide a more representative approximation of fair value. business combinations significant judgment is often required in estimating the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. the company makes estimates and assumptions about conditions of the assets, other costs not captured in the base costs, and consideration for entrepreneurial profit, depreciation, functional obsolescence, and economic obsolescence allocated to the various property, plant and equipment categories considering the perspective of marketplace participants. recently issued accounting pronouncements see note 1 of \"notes to consolidated financial statements\" of this annual report for additional information regarding the status of recently issued accounting pronouncements.']"

       "['item 2. management\\'s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in this quarterly report on form 10-q, or this quarterly report, and in conjunction with our annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year ended december 28, 2013 . this quarterly report contains statements that are not historical in nature, are predictive, or that depend upon or refer to future events or conditions or contain forward-looking statements. statements including, but not limited to, statements regarding the extent and timing of future revenues and expenses and customer demand, statements regarding the deployment of our products, statements regarding our reliance on third parties and other statements using words such as \"anticipates,\" \"believes,\" \"could,\" \"estimates,\" \"expects,\" \"forecasts,\" \"intends,\" \"may,\" \"plans,\" \"projects,\" \"should,\" \"will\" and \"would,\" and words of similar import and the negatives thereof, constitute forward-looking statements. these statements are predictions based upon our current expectations about future events. actual results could vary materially as a result of certain factors, including, but not limited to, those expressed in these statements. we refer you to the \"risk factors,\" \"results of operations,\" \"disclosures about market risk,\" and \"liquidity and capital resources\" sections contained in this quarterly report, and the risks discussed in our other securities exchange commission, or sec, filings, which identify important risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. we urge you to consider these factors carefully in evaluating the forward-looking statements contained in this quarterly report. all subsequent written or oral forward-looking statements attributable to our company or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by these cautionary statements. the forward-looking statements included in this quarterly report are made only as of the date of this quarterly report. we do not intend, and undertake no obligation, to update these forward-looking statements. overview we develop solutions that our customers use to design increasingly small and complex integrated circuits, or ics, and electronic devices. our solutions are designed to help our customers reduce the time to bring an ic or electronic device to market and to reduce their design, development and manufacturing costs. our product offerings include electronic design automation, or eda, software, emulation hardware, and two categories of intellectual property, or ip, commonly referred to as verification ip, or vip, and design ip. we provide maintenance for our software, emulation hardware, and ip product offerings. we also provide engineering services related to methodology, education, hosted design solutions and design services for advanced ics and development of custom ip. these services help our customers manage and accelerate their electronics product development processes. our customers include semiconductor and electronics systems companies that deliver a wide range of electronics products in a number of market segments such as mobile devices, communications, cloud and data center infrastructure, personal computers and other devices. the renewal of many of our customer contracts and our customers\\' decisions to make new purchases from us are dependent upon our customers\\' commencement of new design projects. as a result, our business is significantly influenced by our customers\\' business outlook and investment in new designs and products. the markets our customers serve are sensitive to product price, performance and the time it takes to bring their products to market. in order to be competitive and profitable in these markets, our customers demand high levels of productivity from their design teams, better predictability in shorter development schedules, high performance products and lower development and manufacturing costs. semiconductor and electronics systems companies are responding to these challenges and users\\' demand for increased functionality and smaller devices by combining subsystems - such as radio frequency, or rf, wireless communication, signal processing, microprocessors and memory controllers - onto a single silicon chip, creating a system-on-chip, or soc, or combining multiple chips into a single chip package in a format referred to as system-in-package, or sip. the trend toward subsystem integration has required these chip makers to find solutions to challenges previously addressed by system companies, such as verifying system-level functionality and hardware-software interoperability, and has driven the need for incorporation of preverified commercial ip into these systems. our strategy is to provide our customers with the ability to address the broad range of issues that arise at the silicon, soc, and system levels. our offerings address many of the challenges associated with developing unique silicon circuitry, integrating that circuitry with design ip developed by us or third parties to create socs, designing the packaging and board-level interconnect which links ics and socs, and combining the resulting hardware with software to create electronic systems. significant issues that our customers face in creating their products include reducing power consumption, manufacturing microscopic circuitry, verifying device functionality and achieving technical performance targets, all while meeting aggressive time-to-market and cost requirements. providers of eda and ip solutions must deliver products that address these technical challenges while improving the productivity, predictability, reliability and profitability of the design processes and products of their customers. our products are engineered to improve our customers\\' design productivity and design quality by providing a comprehensive set of eda solutions, emulation hardware and a differentiated portfolio of design ip and vip. product and maintenance revenue includes fees from licenses to use our software and ip, from sales and leases of our emulation hardware products and from royalties generated by our customers\\' shipment of their products containing certain types of our ip. we combine our products and technologies into categories related to major design activities: * functional verification, including emulation hardware; * digital ic design and signoff; * custom ic design; * system interconnect and analysis; and * ip. we have realigned these categories in the current year to better reflect our business objectives. as a result of the realignment, our design for manufacturing, or dfm, products are now categorized together with digital ic design and signoff. we have also established a stand-alone category for our ip offerings, which includes design ip and vip. the product category that was formerly called system interconnect design has been renamed system interconnect and analysis, to better reflect the growing system analysis component in this category. all prior periods presented have been conformed to the current period presentation. the products and technologies included in these categories are combined with ready-to-use packages of technologies assembled from our broad portfolio of ip and other associated components that provide comprehensive solutions for low power, mixed signal and designs at smaller geometries referred to as advanced process nodes, as well as popular designs based on design ip owned and licensed by other companies such as arm holdings plc. these solutions are marketed to users who specialize in areas such as system design and verification, functional verification, logic design, digital implementation, custom ic design and verification, and printed circuit board, or pcb, ic package and sip design and analysis. the major cadence ®️ design and verification platforms are branded as incisive ®️ functional verification, virtuoso ®️ custom ic design, encounter ®️ digital ic design and allegro ®️ system interconnect design. for additional information about our products, see the discussion in item 1, \"business,\" under the heading \"products and product strategy,\" in our annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year ended december 28, 2013 . during the second quarter of fiscal 2013, we acquired tensilica, inc., or tensilica, a privately held provider of configurable dataplane processing units, and cosmic circuits private limited, or cosmic, a privately held provider of intellectual property used in system-on-chip design. these acquisitions, along with other acquired technology and internal development, expanded our design ip offerings, enabling us to offer customized ip as well as broader analog and mixed signal ip solutions to our customers. during the first quarter of fiscal 2014, we acquired forte design systems, a provider of systemc-based high-level synthesis, or hls, and arithmetic ip. during the second quarter of fiscal 2014, we acquired jasper design automation, inc., a leading provider of high-level formal analysis solutions. these acquisitions expanded the capabilities and differentiation of the cadence system development suite, strengthening our offerings for the fast development and verification of advanced design ip. we have identified certain items that management uses as performance indicators to manage our business, including revenue, certain elements of operating expenses and cash flow from operations, and we describe these items further below under the heading \"results of operations\" and \"liquidity and capital resources.\" critical accounting estimates in preparing our condensed consolidated financial statements, we make assumptions, judgments and estimates that can have a significant impact on our revenue, operating income and net income, as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our condensed consolidated balance sheets. we base our assumptions, judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. at least quarterly, we evaluate our assumptions, judgments and estimates, and make changes as deemed necessary. historically, our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to our critical accounting estimates have not differed materially from actual results. for further information about our critical accounting estimates, see the discussion in item 7, \"management\\'s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations,\" under the heading \"critical accounting estimates\" in our annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year ended december 28, 2013 . new accounting standard on may 28, 2014, the financial accounting standards board issued a comprehensive revenue recognition standard that will supersede nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under united states generally accepted accounting principles. the updated standard will become effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 and permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. early adoption is not permitted. we are currently evaluating the effect that the updated standard will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. results of operations financial results for the three and nine months ended september 27, 2014 , as compared to the three and nine months ended september 28, 2013 , reflect increases in: * our product and maintenance revenue, primarily because of increased business levels and increased revenue recognized from bookings in prior periods and incremental revenue from our acquisitions; * product and maintenance related costs consisting of costs associated with our emulation hardware and amortization of technology-related and maintenance-related acquired intangibles; * employee-related costs, primarily consisting of costs related to hiring additional employees, increased compensation for existing employees and incremental costs related to employees added from our fiscal 2014 and 2013 acquisitions; * stock-based compensation; * severance and other termination costs primarily associated with a voluntary early retirement program we offered to certain of our employees during the nine months ended september 27, 2014 ; * restructuring charges due to restructuring activities initiated during the three months ended september 27, 2014; * amortization of acquired intangibles resulting from our fiscal 2014 and 2013 acquisitions; and * our quarterly and year to date provisions for income taxes. revenue we primarily generate revenue from licensing our software and ip, selling or leasing our emulation hardware technology, providing maintenance for our software, emulation hardware and ip, providing engineering services and earning royalties generated from the use of our ip. the timing of our revenue is significantly affected by the mix of software, emulation hardware and ip products in the bookings executed in any given period and whether the revenue for such bookings is recognized over multiple periods or up front, upon completion of delivery. we seek to achieve a consistent revenue mix such that approximately 90% of our revenue is recurring in nature, and the remainder of the resulting revenue is recognized up-front, upon completion of delivery. our ability to achieve this mix in any single fiscal period may be impacted primarily by hardware sales, because revenue for hardware sales is generally recognized up front in the period in which delivery is completed. for an additional description of the impact of emulation hardware sales on the timing of revenue recognition, see the discussion in item 7, \"management\\'s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations,\" under the heading \"critical accounting estimates - revenue recognition\" in our annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year ended december 28, 2013 . revenue by period the following table shows our revenue for the three months ended september 27, 2014 and september 28, 2013 and the change in revenue between periods: three months ended change september 27, 2014 september 28, 2013 amount percentage (in millions, except percentages) product and maintenance $ 374.1 $ 341.6 $

revenue between periods: nine months ended change september 27, 2014 september 28, 2013 amount percentage (in millions, except percentages) product and maintenance $ 1,085.9 $ 1,007.9 $ 78.0 % services 71.9 75.5 (3.6 ) (5 )% total revenue $ 1,157.8 $ 1,083.4 $ 74.4 % product and maintenance revenue increased during the three and nine months ended september 27, 2014 , as compared to the three and nine months ended september 28, 2013 , primarily because of increased business levels, increased revenue recognized from bookings in prior periods and incremental revenue recognized from our fiscal 2013 acquisitions. services revenue may fluctuate from period to period based on demand for, and our resources to fulfill, our services and customized ip offerings. no single customer accounted for 10% or more of total revenue during the three and nine months ended september 27, 2014 or september 28, 2013 . revenue by product group the following table shows the percentage of revenue contributed by each of our five product groups for the past five consecutive quarters: three months ended september 28, 2013 december 28, 2013 march 29, 2014 june 28, 2014 september 27, 2014

customers the ability to remix among software products. additionally, we have arrangements with customers that include a combination of our products, with the actual product selection and number of licensed users to be determined at a later date. for these arrangements, we estimate the allocation of the revenue to product groups based upon the expected usage of our products. the actual usage of our products by these customers may differ and, if that proves to be the case, the revenue allocation in the table above would differ. revenue by geography three months ended change september 27, 2014

$ 1,083.4 $ 74.4 % most of our revenue is transacted in the united states dollar. however, certain revenue transactions are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the japanese yen, and we recognize reduced revenue from those contracts in periods when the japanese yen weakens in value against the united states dollar and additional revenue from those contracts in periods when the japanese yen strengthens against the united states dollar. for an additional description of how changes in foreign exchange rates affect our condensed consolidated financial statements, see the discussion under item 3, \"quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk - foreign currency risk.\" revenue for asia increased during the three and nine months ended september 27, 2014 , as compared to the three and nine months ended september 28, 2013 , primarily due to increases in revenue from our software business and emulation hardware installations. revenue for japan decreased during the three and nine months ended september 27, 2014 , as compared to the three and nine months ended september 28, 2013 , primarily due to business conditions facing our japanese customers. because of these conditions, we expect lower revenue for japan during fiscal 2014, as compared to fiscal 2013. for the primary factors contributing to our increase in revenue in other geographies, see

product and maintenance cost of product and maintenance includes costs associated with the sale and lease of our emulation hardware and licensing of our software and ip products, certain employee salary, benefits and other employee-related costs, cost of our customer support services, amortization of technology-related and maintenance-related acquired intangibles, as well as the costs of technical documentation and royalties payable to third-party vendors. costs associated with our emulation hardware products include materials, assembly and overhead. these additional hardware manufacturing costs make our cost of emulation hardware product higher, as a percentage of revenue, than our cost of software and ip products. a summary of cost of product and maintenance is as follows: three months ended change september 27, 2014 september 28, 2013 amount percentage (in millions, except percentages) product and maintenance-related costs $ 26.9 $ 25.3 $ 1.6 % amortization of acquired intangibles 10.1 7.2 2.9 % total cost of product and maintenance $ 37.0 $ 32.5 $ 4.5 % nine months ended change september 27, 2014 september 28, 2013 amount percentage (in millions, except

product and maintenance depends primarily upon our emulation hardware product sales and gross margins in any given period. employee salary, benefits and other employee-related costs, and the timing and extent to which we acquire intangible assets, acquire or license third-parties\\' intellectual property or technology and sell our products that include such acquired or licensed intellectual property or technology, also impact cost of product and maintenance. the changes in product and maintenance-related costs for the three and nine months ended september 27, 2014 , as compared to the three and nine months ended september 28, 2013 , were due to the following: change three months ended nine months ended (in millions) emulation hardware costs $ 1.6 $ 17.4 other items -- (0.5 ) $ 1.6 $ 16.9 emulation hardware costs increased during the nine months ended september 27, 2014 , as compared to the nine months ended september 28, 2013 , due to a higher volume of emulation hardware products sold. gross margins on our emulation hardware products may fluctuate based on customer pricing strategies, product competition and product life cycle. gross margins on our emulation hardware products decreased during the three and nine months ended september 27, 2014 , as compared to the three and nine months ended september 28, 2013 . we expect lower gross margins on the sale of our emulation hardware products for fiscal 2014, as compared to fiscal 2013, primarily due to an increasingly competitive environment for emulation hardware. amortization of acquired intangibles included in cost of product and maintenance increased during the three months ended september 27, 2014 , as compared to the three months ended september 28, 2013 , primarily due to the increase in amortization of intangible assets associated with our fiscal 2014 acquisitions. amortization of acquired intangibles included in cost of product and maintenance increased during the nine months ended september 27, 2014 , as compared to the nine months ended september 28, 2013 , primarily due to the increase in amortization of intangible assets associated with our fiscal 2014 and 2013 acquisitions. we expect amortization of acquired intangibles to increase for the remainder of fiscal 2014, as compared to the same period in fiscal 2013, primarily due to amortization of intangible assets recorded in connection with our fiscal 2014 acquisitions. for an additional description of our expected amortization of intangible assets, see note 4 of the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements. cost of services cost of services primarily includes employee salary, benefits and other employee-related costs to perform work on revenue-generating projects, costs to maintain the infrastructure necessary to manage a services organization, and provisions for contract losses, if any. cost of services will fluctuate from period to period based on our utilization of design services engineers on revenue-generating projects or on internal development projects. operating expenses our operating expenses include marketing and sales, research and development and general and administrative expenses. factors that may cause our operating expenses to fluctuate include changes in the number of employees due to acquisitions and hiring, foreign exchange rates, stock-based compensation and the impact of our variable compensation programs that are driven by overall operating results. our employee salary and other compensation-related costs increased during the three and nine months ended september 27, 2014 , as compared to the three and nine months ended september 28, 2013 , primarily due to hiring of additional employees for our research and development and sales activities, increased compensation for existing employees and incremental costs related to employees added from our fiscal 2014 and 2013 acquisitions. during the second quarter of fiscal 2014, we initiated a voluntary early retirement program. the program was offered to certain eligible employees in north america and japan and enrollment for those employees was completed prior to september 27, 2014 . we recorded costs associated with this program of approximately $0.5 million and $9.7 million in our operating expenses during the three and nine months ended september 27, 2014 , respectively. the increase in operating expenses associated with this program is included in the change in severance and other termination costs presented in the analysis of our operating expenses below. during the third quarter of fiscal 2014, we initiated restructuring activities and recorded restructuring and other charges of approximately $11.0 million related to severance payments, severance-related benefits, costs associated with outplacement services and impairment of certain property plant and equipment. many of our operating expenses are transacted in various foreign currencies. we recognize lower expenses in periods when the united states dollar strengthens in value against other currencies and we recognize higher expenses when the united states dollar weakens against other currencies. for an additional description of how changes in foreign exchange rates affect our condensed consolidated financial statements, see the discussion in item 3, \"quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk - foreign currency risk.\" we expect our total operating expenses to increase during the remainder of fiscal 2014, as compared to the same period in fiscal 2013, primarily due to the addition of employees through our fiscal 2014 acquisitions and hiring of research and development and sales personnel, partially offset by reductions in expense as a result of our restructuring activities. our operating expenses for the three and nine months ended september 27, 2014 and september 28, 2013 were as follows: three months ended change september 27, 2014 september 28, 2013 amount percentage (in millions, except percentages) marketing and sales $ 100.4 $ 98.1 $ 2.3 % research and development 148.7 138.1 10.6 % general and administrative 25.9 27.6 (1.7 ) (6 )% total operating

to the following: change three months ended nine months ended (in millions) professional services $ 1.5 $ (2.6 ) severance and other termination costs 0.2 1.7 salary, benefits and other employee-related costs 0.5 1.5 facilities and other infrastructure costs (1.5 ) (2.1 ) changes in fair value of contingent consideration (1.8 ) (2.1 ) other items (0.6 ) (1.5 ) $ (1.7 ) $ (5.1 ) restructuring and other charges we have initiated various restructuring plans to better align our resources with our business strategy, including a restructuring plan we initiated during the three months ended september 27, 2014 , or the 2014 restructuring plan, and a restructuring plan we initiated during fiscal 2013. for an additional description of the 2014 restructuring plan, see note 9 in the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements. we recorded restructuring and other charges during the three months ended september 27, 2014 of $11.0 million related to the 2014 restructuring plan, including $8.3 million for severance and related benefits and $2.6 million related to the impairment of certain property plant and equipment. restructuring and other charges recorded during the three and nine months ended september 28, 2013 consisted primarily of severance and other benefits related to our restructuring activities initiated during fiscal 2013. because the restructuring charges and related benefits are derived from management\\'s estimates made during the formulation of the restructuring plans, based on then-currently available information, our restructuring plans may not achieve the benefits anticipated on the timetable or at the level contemplated. demand for our products and services and, ultimately, our future financial performance, is difficult to predict with any degree of certainty. accordingly, additional actions, including further restructuring of our operations, may be required in the future. stock-based compensation stock-based compensation expense is recorded within the various components of our costs and expenses. stock-based compensation included in operating expenses increased $4.3 million and $13.3 million during the three and nine months ended september 27, 2014 , respectively, as compared to the three and nine months ended september 28, 2013 , respectively, primarily because of higher grant-date fair values. we expect stock-based compensation to increase during the remainder of fiscal 2014, as compared to the same period of fiscal 2013, because we expect that new awards granted during fiscal 2014 will have higher grant date fair values compared to grants made in previous years and because awards vesting during fiscal 2014 generally have higher grant date fair values than awards that vested during fiscal 2013. amortization of acquired intangibles three months ended change september 27, 2014 september 28, 2013 amount percentage (in millions, except percentages) amortization of acquired intangibles $ 6.3 $ 5.1 $ 1.2 % nine months ended change september 27, 2014 september 28, 2013 amount percentage (in millions, except percentages) amortization of acquired intangibles $ 17.1 $ 14.3 $ 2.8 % the increase in amortization of acquired intangibles during the three and nine months ended september 27, 2014 , as compared to the three and nine months ended september 28, 2013 , resulted from increased amortization of intangible assets related to our fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013 acquisitions, which was partially offset by certain acquired intangibles becoming fully amortized. we expect amortization of acquired intangibles to increase during the remainder of fiscal 2014, as compared to the same period in fiscal 2013, due to the amortization of intangible assets recorded in connection with our fiscal 2014 acquisitions. for an additional description of our expected amortization of intangible assets, see note 4 of the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements. interest expense three months ended nine months ended september 27, 2014 september 28, 2013 september 27, 2014 september 28, 2013 (in millions) contractual interest expense: 2013 notes $ -- $ 0.5 $ -- $ 1.6

giving effect to our 4.375% senior notes due 2024, or our 2024 notes. for an additional description of our 2024 notes, see note 16 of the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements. income taxes the following table presents the provision for income taxes and the effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended september 27, 2014 and september 28, 2013 : three months ended nine months ended september 27, 2014 september 28, 2013 september 27, 2014 september 28, 2013 (in millions, except percentages) provision for income taxes $ 8.6 $ 2.4 $ 20.4 $ 3.0 effective tax rate 18.6 % 5.8 % 17.9 % 2.3 % our provision for income taxes for the three and nine months ended september 27, 2014 primarily resulted from federal, state and foreign income taxes on our anticipated fiscal 2014 income. our foreign earnings are generally subject to lower statutory tax rates than our united states earnings. in addition, our provision for income taxes for the three and nine months ended september 27, 2014 does not include the potential tax benefit of the united states federal research tax credit, which expired in december 2013. the expiration of the research tax credit is estimated to increase our estimated annual effective tax rate for fiscal 2014 by 3%. our provision for income taxes for the three months ended september 28, 2013 was primarily related to federal, state and foreign income taxes on our anticipated fiscal 2013 income. our provision for income taxes for the nine months ended september 28, 2013 was primarily related to federal, state and foreign income taxes on our fiscal 2013 income partially offset by a tax benefit of $33.7 million from the release of an uncertain tax position, including related interest and penalties, and a $5.9 million tax benefit from the retroactive enactment of the fiscal 2012 united states federal research tax credit during the period. we estimate our annual effective tax rate for fiscal 2014 to be approximately 18%. our estimate excludes tax effects of certain stock compensation, potential acquisitions, and other items which we cannot anticipate. our future effective tax rates may be materially impacted by tax amounts associated with our foreign earnings at rates different from the federal statutory rate, research credits, the tax impact of stock-based compensation, accounting for uncertain tax positions, business combinations, closure of statute of limitations or settlement of tax audits, changes in valuation allowance and changes in tax law. a significant amount of our foreign earnings is generated by our subsidiaries organized in ireland and hungary. our future effective tax rates may be adversely affected to the extent earnings are lower in countries where we have lower statutory tax rates or we repatriate certain foreign earnings on which united states taxes have not been previously accrued. for further discussion regarding our income taxes, see note 6 in the notes to consolidated financial statements in our annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year ended december 28, 2013 . liquidity and capital resources as of september 27, 2014 december 28, 2013 change (in millions) cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments $ 595.5 $ 633.0 $ (37.5 ) net working capital $ 55.6 $ 72.9 $ (17.3 ) cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of september 27, 2014 , our principal sources of liquidity consisted of $595.5 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, as compared to $633.0 million as of december 28, 2013 . our primary source of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments during the nine months ended september 27, 2014 was customer payments for products, maintenance and services, borrowings under our revolving credit facility, proceeds from the exercise of stock options and proceeds from stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan. our primary uses of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments during the nine months ended september 27, 2014 were payments relating to salaries, benefits, other employee-related costs and operating expenses, our fiscal 2014 acquisitions, payments on our revolving credit facility, repurchases of our common stock, purchases of inventory, purchases of property, plant and equipment, tax payments and payments related to our recent restructuring plans and our voluntary early retirement program. approximately 68% of our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were held by our foreign subsidiaries as of september 27, 2014 . our intent is to permanently reinvest our earnings from certain foreign operations. we do not anticipate we will need to repatriate dividends from foreign operations that are permanently reinvested in order to fund our domestic operations. in the event that dividends from foreign operations that are currently permanently reinvested are needed to fund united states liquidity, we could be required to accrue and pay additional taxes in order to repatriate these funds. we maintain an investment portfolio of approximately $100 million in marketable debt securities, including corporate debt securities, united states treasury securities, united states government agency securities, bank certificates of deposit and commercial paper. our investments in marketable debt securities are classified as available-for-sale and are included in short-term investments as of september 27, 2014 . our investments are made in accordance with our cash investment policy, which governs the amounts and types of investments we hold in our portfolio. our investment portfolio could be affected by various risks and uncertainties including credit risk, interest rate risk and general market risk, as outlined in item 3, \"quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk\" and part ii, item 1a, \"risk factors.\" we have a $250 million revolving credit facility that may be used to finance working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other business purposes. any outstanding loans drawn under the credit facility are payable on or before september 19, 2019 . the credit facility contains customary negative covenants that, among other things, restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness, grant liens and make certain investments, asset dispositions and restricted payments. in addition, the credit facility contains certain financial covenants that require us to maintain a leverage ratio of not greater than 2.75 to 1, subject to certain exceptions, and requires that we maintain an interest coverage ratio of at least 3 to 1. as of september 27, 2014 , we had no outstanding borrowings under the credit facility and were in compliance with the financial covenants. for an additional description of this revolving credit facility, see note 2 in the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements. we expect that current cash, cash equivalents and short-term investment balances, cash flows that are generated from operations, proceeds from our 2024 notes and cash borrowings available under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our domestic and international working capital needs, and other capital and liquidity requirements, including servicing the maturity or conversion of our 2015 notes, acquisitions and share repurchases, if any, for at least the next 12 months. net working capital net working capital decreased by $17.3 million as of september 27, 2014 , as compared to december 28, 2013 , due to the following: change (in millions) decrease in cash and cash equivalents (35.8 ) increase in convertible notes (12.9 ) decrease in short-term investments (1.8 ) increase in current portion of deferred revenue (0.2 ) increase in inventories 10.9 decreases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities 11.0 increase in prepaid expenses and other 11.5 $ (17.3 ) cash flows from operating activities nine months ended september 27, 2014 september 28, 2013 change (in millions) cash provided by operating activities $ 184.7 $ 248.4 $ (63.7 ) cash flows from operating activities decreased $63.7 million during the nine months ended september 27, 2014 , as compared to september 28, 2013 , due to the following: change (in millions) net income, net of non-cash related gains and losses $ 18.3 changes in operating assets and liabilities, net of effect of acquired businesses (82.0 ) $ (63.7 ) cash flows from operating activities include net income, adjusted for certain non-cash items, as well as changes in the balances of certain assets and liabilities. our cash flows from operating activities are significantly influenced by business levels and the payment terms set forth in our license agreements. the decrease in cash flows from operating activities for the nine months ended september 27, 2014 , as compared to the nine months ended september 28, 2013 , was primarily due to the timing of cash receipts from customers, working capital requirements, payments under our recent restructuring plans, payments for our voluntary early retirement program and an increase in cash paid for taxes, net of tax refunds. we expect to pay an additional $11.7 million after september 27, 2014 related to our restructuring activities to date, of which we expect approximately $9.1 million will be paid within the next twelve months. we expect to pay $6.0 million related to our voluntary retirement program after september 27, 2014 , of which we expect approximately $5.7 million will be paid within the next 12 months. we expect that cash flows from operating activities will fluctuate in future periods due to a number of factors, including our operating results, tax payments and the timing of our billings, collections and disbursements. cash flows from investing activities nine months ended september 27, 2014 september 28, 2013 change (in millions) cash used for investing activities $ (191.3 ) $ (417.1 ) $ 225.8 the changes in net cash used for investing activities for the nine months ended september 27, 2014 , as compared to the nine months ended september 28, 2013 , were due to the following: change (in millions) cash paid in business combinations and asset acquisitions, net of cash acquired $ 225.6 proceeds from the sale and maturity of available-for-sale securities 12.8 purchases of property, plant and equipment 8.0 proceeds from the sale of long-term investments (6.2 ) purchases of available-for-sale securities (14.4 ) $ 225.8 cash paid in business combinations and asset acquisitions relates to our fiscal 2014 and 2013 acquisitions. for an additional description of the acquisitions completed during the nine months ended september 27, 2014 , see note 3 in the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements. we maintain an investment portfolio of approximately $100 million in marketable debt securities. the proceeds from, purchases of and maturities of available-for-sale securities are primarily related to normal transactions within our investment portfolio. we expect to continue our investing activities, including purchasing property, plant and equipment, purchasing intangible assets, business combinations, purchasing software licenses, and making long-term equity investments. cash flows from financing activities nine months ended september 27, 2014 september 28, 2013 change (in millions) cash provided by financing activities $ (27.9 ) $ 77.4 $ (105.3 ) the changes in net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended september 27, 2014 , as compared to the nine months ended september 28, 2013 , were due to the following: change (in millions) payments for repurchases of common stock $ (62.6 ) payment on revolving credit facility (50.0 ) stock received for payment of employee taxes on vesting of restricted stock (4.2 ) tax effect related to employee stock transactions allocated to equity (3.7 ) payment of acquisition-related contingent consideration (1.2 ) principal payments on receivable financing 2.5 proceeds from the issuance of common stock 14.0 other items (0.1 ) $ (105.3 ) during the nine months ended september 27, 2014 , we used $62.6 million of cash and cash equivalents to repurchase shares of our common stock. we expect to repurchase up to a total of $100.0 million of our common stock during fiscal 2014, and we may repurchase additional shares of our common stock during fiscal 2015 in connection with our current repurchase plan. for an additional description of our share repurchase programs and repurchase authorizations, see part ii, item 2, \"unregistered sales of equity securities and use of proceeds.\" other factors affecting liquidity and capital resources revolving credit facility on september 19, 2014, we amended our senior revolving credit facility on terms substantially similar to the prior credit agreement, except that, as amended, our revolving credit facility (i) is unsecured, (ii) expires on september 19, 2019, (iii) currently has no subsidiary guarantors and (iv) includes certain amendments to the negative and financial covenants. our revolving credit facility provides for borrowings up to $250.0 million, with the right to request increased capacity up to an additional $150.0 million upon the receipt of lender commitments, for total maximum borrowings of $400.0 million. 2024 notes on october 9, 2014, we issued $350.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.375% senior notes due 2024, or the 2024 notes, due october 15, 2024. we received net proceeds of $342.4 million from issuance of the 2024 notes, net of a discount of $1.4 million and issuance costs of $6.2 million. interest will be payable in cash semi-annually commencing on april 15, 2015. the 2024 notes are unsecured and rank equal in right of payment to all of our existing and future senior indebtedness.the proceeds of the 2024 notes are available for general corporate purposes, which may include the retirement of debt, working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and strategic transactions. convertible notes as of september 27, 2014 , we had convertible notes outstanding with a net liability value of $337.7 million that mature on june 1, 2015. the principal maturity value of our 2015 notes is $350.0 million . the total cash payable upon the early conversion of these notes, as determined by the indenture of each security, will be their principal amount plus any additional conversion value that would be due upon conversion. we will owe additional cash to the note holders upon early conversion if our stock price exceeds $7.55 per share. we entered into hedges with counterparties to limit our exposure to the additional cash payments above the principal amount of the 2015 notes that may be due to the holders upon conversion. in separate transactions, we sold warrants, or the 2015 warrants, with a strike price of $10.78 per share. although our incremental cash payout exposure above the conversion price is limited by the hedges to the $350.0 million outstanding principal value of the 2015 notes and accrued interest, we will experience dilution to our stock and to our diluted earnings per share from the outstanding 2015 warrants to the extent our average closing stock price exceeds $10.78 in any fiscal quarter until the 2015 notes are converted and the 2015 warrants are settled. additionally, holders may convert their 2015 notes into cash during any quarter following a quarter in which our stock price closes above $9.81 for at least 20 of the last 30 trading days. the 2015 notes are convertible into cash from september 28, 2014 through january 3, 2015 because our closing stock price exceeded $9.81 for at least 20 of the last 30 trading days prior to september 27, 2014 . while holders of the 2015 notes have the right to convert their notes, we do not anticipate a significant number of conversions before the june 1, 2015 maturity date of the 2015 notes. if the holders of our 2015 notes elect to convert their notes into cash, we would be required to make cash payments of up to $350.0 million and accrued interest prior to the maturity of the 2015 notes. as of september 27, 2014 , a total of one thousand dollars of the 2015 notes had been tendered for early conversion. in connection with the 2015 notes, we entered into the 2015 notes hedges and sold warrants to limit our exposure to the additional cash payments above the $350.0 million principal balance in the event of a cash conversion of the 2015 notes. we believe that cash generated from our operating activities in future periods, proceeds from our 2024 notes, and access to our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to service the maturity or conversion of our 2015 notes. for an additional description of the 2015 notes, the conversion terms thereof and the hedge and warrants transactions, see note 2 in the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements.',\n",
       " 'item 2. management\\'s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations. the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read

comprehensive genetic information into mainstream medical practice to improve the quality of healthcare for billions of people. our goal is to aggregate most of the world\\'s genetic tests into a single service with higher quality, faster turnaround time and lower pricing than many single gene tests and panel tests today. by aggregating large numbers of currently available genetic tests into a single service, we can achieve great economies of scale that allow us to not only provide primary single gene or multi-gene tests but also to generate and store additional genetic information on behalf of the patient for future use. we refer to the service of managing genetic information over the course of disease or the lifetime of a patient as \"genome management.\" in addition, as more individuals gain access to their genetic information, we believe that sharing genetic information will provide an economic opportunity for patients and us to participate in advancing the understanding and treatment of disease. we refer to this as the \"genome network.\" we launched our first commercial offering in november 2013 with an offering of more than 200 genes. in october 2015, we expanded our test menu to more than 600 genes in production, offering tests for more than 120 disorders in cardiovascular, hereditary cancer, neurology, pediatrics and other rare diseases. in march 2016, we further expanded our test menu with expanded panels for neurology, pediatrics, and rare diseases. we now have more than 1,000 genes in production and provide a variety of diagnostic tests that can be used in multiple indications. these additions to our test menu have resulted from a series of process improvements that have enabled us to continue to expand our test menu while maintaining our strategy of lowering the cost of genetic testing. we have continued to experienced rapid growth. for the six months ended june 30, 2016 and 2015 our revenue was $9.5 million and $3.0 million, respectively and we incurred net losses of $50.4 million and $42.9 million, respectively. at june 30, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of $225.4 million. we increased our number of employees to 298 at june 30, 2016 from 243 on june 30, 2015. our sales force grew to 38 at june 30, 2016 from 21 at june 30, 2015. we expect headcount will continue to increase in the remainder of 2016, as we add staff to support our anticipated growth. since our commercial launch through june 30, 2016, we have delivered approximately 45,000 billable tests. sales of our tests have grown significantly from approximately 6,700 billable tests in the six months ended june 30, 2015 to approximately 22,000 billable tests in the six months ended june 30, 2016. we estimate that the u.s. market for hereditary cancer tests is greater than $650.0 million per year and thus represents a key growth opportunity for us. in addition, we have expanded our test menu to include the non-cancer test portion of our market, which we expect will drive additional sales volume. on a historical basis through june 30, 2016, approximately 24% of the billable tests we performed have been billable to institutions and patients, and the remainder have been billable to third-party payers. many of the gene tests on our assays are tests for which private insurers reimburse. however, because we do not have reimbursement policies or contracts with very many private insurers, our claims for reimbursement from them may be denied upon submission, and we must appeal the claims. the appeals process is time consuming and expensive, and may not result in payment. even if we are successful in achieving reimbursement, we may be paid at lower rates than if we were under contract with the third-party payer. when there is not a contracted rate for reimbursement, there is typically a greater co-insurance or co-payment requirement from the patient which may result in further delay or decreased likelihood of collection. we intend to continue to invest aggressively in our business. in 2015 we entered into a lease agreement for a new production facility in san francisco, california. this lease expires in july 2026 and at june 30, 2016, aggregate future minimum lease payments for the new facility are approximately $71.9 million. we expect to incur capital expenditures for the new facility of at least $9.2 million and we will receive a $5.2 million lease incentive in the form of reimbursement from the landlord for a portion of the costs of leasehold improvements we make to the new facility. as a result of these and other factors, we expect to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future and may need to raise additional capital in order to fund our operations. if we are unable to achieve our revenue growth objectives and successfully manage our costs, we may not be able to achieve profitability. we believe that the keys to our future growth will be to steadily increase the amount of genetic content we offer, consistently improve the client experience, drive physician and patient utilization of our website for ordering and delivery of results, increase the number of partners working with us to add value for our clients and consistently drive down the price per gene for genetic analysis and interpretation. factors affecting our performance number of billable tests the growth in our genetic testing business is tied to the number of tests for which we bill third-party payers, institutions or patients, which we refer to as billable tests. we bill for our services following delivery of the billable test report derived from testing samples and interpreting the results. we incur the expenses associated with a test in the period in which the test is processed regardless of when payment is received with respect to that test. we believe the number of billable tests in any period is an important indicator of the growth in our business. success obtaining reimbursement our ability to increase the number of billable tests and our revenue will depend in part on our success achieving broad reimbursement coverage for our tests from third-party payers. reimbursement may depend on a number of factors, including a payer\\'s determination that a test is appropriate, medically necessary and cost-effective. because each payer makes its own decision as to whether to establish a policy or enter into a contract to reimburse for our testing services, seeking these approvals is a time-consuming and costly process. in addition, clinicians may decide not to order our tests if the cost of the test is not covered by insurance. because we require an ordering physician to requisition a test, our revenue growth also depends on our ability to successfully promote the adoption of our testing services and expand our base of ordering clinicians. we believe that establishing coverage from third-party payers, including the centers for medicare and medicaid services, or cms, is an important factor in gaining adoption by ordering clinicians. we have received approval as a medicare provider, which allows us to bill for our services to medicare patients. in april 2016, we announced that cms have begun providing payments for our multi-gene tests for hereditary breast cancer-related disorders. the interim payment per test, under cpt code 81432, is $622.53. cms has stated it will set final pricing for this new code later in 2016, and we have proposed a higher price in response. in october, 2015, we entered into a national master business agreement (the \"agreement\") with blue cross and blue shield association (\"bcbsa\"). the agreement facilitates our ability to enter into supply agreements for our products and services with bcbsa affiliates, licensees and certain other entities. the agreement does not provide for the sale of our products or services directly, nor is there any commitment by bcbsa to purchase products or services from us. as of june 30, 2016, we had secured payer contracts with several regional bcbsa plans, as well as with other third-party payers, providing coverage for patients in a total of ten states, as well as those covered by the federal employee plan. in july 2016, we entered into an agreement to become part of aetna\\'s laboratory network, effective in august 2016. if we are not able to obtain and maintain adequate reimbursement from third-party payers for our testing services and expand the base of clinicians ordering our tests, we may not be able to effectively increase the number of billable tests or our revenue. ability to lower the costs associated with performing our tests reducing the costs associated with performing our genetic tests is both a near-term focus and a strategic objective of ours. over the long term we will need to reduce the cost of raw materials by improving the output efficiency of our assays and laboratory processes, modifying our platform-agnostic assays and laboratory processes to use materials and technologies that provide equal or greater quality at lower cost, improving how we manage our materials and negotiating favorable terms for our materials purchases. we also intend to design and implement hardware and software tools that will reduce personnel cost for both laboratory and clinical operations by increasing personnel efficiency and thus lowering labor costs per test. ability to expand our genetic content as we reduce our costs, we intend to continue to expand our test menus by steadily releasing additional genetic content for the same or lower prices per test, ultimately leading to affordable whole genome services. the breadth and flexibility of our offering will be a critical factor in our ability to address new markets for genetic testing services. both of these will be critical to our ability to continue to grow the volume of billable tests we deliver. investment in our business and timing of expenses we plan to continue to invest significantly in our genetic testing, genome management and genome network business. we deploy state-of-the-art and costly technologies in our genetic testing services, and we intend to significantly scale our infrastructure, including our testing capacity and information systems. we also expect to incur software development costs as we seek to further automate our laboratory processes and our genetic interpretation and report sign-out procedures, to scale our customer service capabilities and to expand the functionality of our website. as part of our growth, we also plan to hire additional personnel, including software engineers, sales and marketing personnel, research and development personnel, medical specialists, biostatisticians and geneticists. we will also incur costs to build out our new production facility. in addition, we expect to incur ongoing expenses as a result of operating as a public company. the expenses we incur may vary significantly by quarter, as we focus on building out different aspects of our business. how we recognize revenue our historical revenue has been recognized when cash is received. while we recognized $1.3 million of revenue on an accrual basis in the six months ended june 30, 2016, and while we anticipate the number of payers for whom we recognize revenue upon delivery of test results will increase in the future, we do not expect to recognize significant amounts of revenue on an accrual basis for some time. until we achieve and maintain a predictable pattern of collection at a consistent payment amount from a large number of payers, we will continue to recognize the substantial majority of our revenue when cash is received. because the timing and amount of cash payments received from payers is difficult to predict, we expect that our revenue will fluctuate significantly in any given quarter. for the six months ended june 30, 2016 and 2015, amounts billed for tests delivered totaled $23.4 million and $9.1 million, respectively. in the six months ended june 30, 2016, we recognized revenue of $7.0 million related to amounts billed for tests delivered during 2016, $2.4 million related to amounts billed for tests delivered during 2015 and $0.1 million related to amounts billed for tests delivered in 2014. of the total revenue recognized for the six months ended june 30, 2016 of $9.5 million, $8.2 million was recognized upon cash receipt, and the remainder was recognized on an accrual basis. it is difficult to predict future revenue from previously delivered but unpaid tests. accordingly, we cannot provide any assurance as to when, if ever, or to what extent any of these amounts will be collected. because we are in the early stages of commercializing our tests, we have had limited payment and collection history. notwithstanding our efforts to obtain payment for these tests, payers may deny our claims, in whole or in part, and we may never receive revenue from any previously delivered but unpaid tests. revenue from these tests, if any, may not be equal to the billed amount due to a number of factors, including differences in reimbursement rates, the amounts of patient co-payments, the existence of secondary payers and claims denials. in addition, private payers often ask us to refrain from submitting claims for a period of up to 60 days after contract execution, which can cause the timing of payments to vary significantly during the months after contract signing, which may in turn cause our revenues to vary significantly from quarter to quarter. we incur and recognize expenses for tests in the period in which the test is conducted and recognize revenue for tests in the period in which our revenue recognition criteria are met. accordingly, any revenue that we receive in respect of previously delivered but unpaid tests will favorably affect our results of operations in future periods. financial overview revenue we generate revenue from the sale of our tests which provide the analysis and associated interpretation of the sequencing of parts of the genome. clients are billed upon delivery of test results to the physician. for most of our customers, we do not have sufficient history of collection and are not yet able to determine a predictable pattern of collection, and therefore we currently recognize revenue when cash is received. our ability to increase our revenue will depend on our ability to increase our market penetration, obtain contracted reimbursement coverage from third-party payers and increase the rate at which we are paid for tests performed. cost of revenue cost of revenue reflects the aggregate costs incurred in delivering test results to clinicians and includes expenses for materials and supplies, personnel costs, equipment and infrastructure expenses associated with testing and allocated overhead including rent, equipment depreciation and utilities. costs associated with performing our test are recorded as the patient\\'s sample is processed regardless of whether and when revenue is recognized with respect to that test. as a result, our cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue may vary significantly from period to period because we generally do not recognize revenue in the period in which costs are incurred. we expect cost of revenue to generally increase in line with the increase in the number of tests we perform. however, we expect that the cost per test will decrease over time due to the efficiencies we may gain as test volume increases and from automation and other cost reductions. operating expenses our operating expenses are classified into three categories: research and development, selling and marketing, and general and administrative. for each category, the largest component is personnel costs, which include salaries, employee benefit costs, bonuses, commissions, as applicable, and stock-based compensation expense. research and development research and development expenses represent costs incurred to develop our technology and future tests. these costs are principally for process development associated with our efforts to expand the number of genes we can evaluate in our tests, with our efforts to lower the cost of performing our test. in addition, we incur process development costs to further develop the software we use to operate our laboratory, analyze the data it generates, process customer orders, deliver reports and automate our business processes. these costs consist of personnel costs, laboratory supplies and equipment expenses, consulting costs and allocated overhead including rent, information technology, equipment depreciation and utilities. we expense all research and development costs in the periods in which they are incurred. we expect our research and development expenses will increase slightly in 2016, compared to 2015, as we continue to invest in research and development activities related to developing additional tests and reducing testing costs. selling and marketing selling and marketing expenses consist of personnel costs, client service expenses, direct marketing expenses, educational and promotional expenses, market research and analysis, and allocated overhead including rent, information technology, equipment depreciation and utilities. we expect our selling expenses will increase in 2016, compared to 2015, primarily driven by the cost of hiring additional sales account executives associated with efforts to further penetrate the domestic market. general and administrative general and administrative expenses include executive, finance and accounting, legal and human resources functions. these expenses include personnel-related costs, audit and legal expenses, consulting costs, and allocated overhead including rent, information technology, equipment depreciation and utilities. we expect our general and administrative expenses will increase in 2016, compared to 2015, as we scale our operations and as we continue to incur expenses related to operating as a public company, including expenses related to compliance with the rules and regulations of the sec and the new york stock exchange, additional insurance expenses, investor relations activities and other administration and professional services. other income (expense), net other income (expense), net, primarily consists of interest income and the net exchange gain/loss on foreign currency transactions related to the operations of our subsidiary in chile. for the three and six months ended june 30, 2016, other income (expense), net also included losses on disposal of assets related to the closure of our chilean facility. interest expense interest expense is attributable to our financing obligations under capital lease agreements and our loan and security agreement. critical accounting policies and estimates management\\'s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles, or u.s. gaap. the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported revenue generated and expenses incurred during the reporting periods. our estimates are based on our historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions and any such differences may be material. we believe that the accounting policies discussed below are critical to understanding our historical and future performance, as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving management\\'s judgments and estimates. revenue recognition we generate revenue from delivery of test reports generated from our assays. revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; the fee is fixed or determinable; and collectability is reasonably assured. the assessment of the fixed or determinable nature of the fees charged for testing performed and the collectability of those fees require significant judgment by management. when evaluating these criteria, we consider whether we have sufficient history to reliably estimate a payer\\'s payment pattern. we review the number of tests paid against the number of tests billed over a period of at least several months and the payer\\'s outstanding balance for unpaid tests to determine whether payments are being made at a consistently high percentage of tests billed and at appropriate amounts given the amount billed. for most payers, we have not been able to demonstrate a predictable pattern of collectability, and therefore recognize revenue when payment is received. for payers who have demonstrated a consistent pattern of payment of tests billed at appropriate amounts, we recognize revenue upon delivery of test results. deferred tax assets we use the liability method of accounting for income taxes. under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and the tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. we assess the likelihood that the resulting deferred tax assets will be realized. a valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. at june 30, 2016, our total gross deferred tax assets were $60.7 million. due to our lack of earnings history and uncertainties surrounding our ability to generate future taxable income, the net deferred tax assets have been fully offset by a valuation allowance. the deferred tax assets were primarily comprised of federal and state tax net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. utilization of the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may be subject to an annual limitation due to historical or future ownership percentage change rules provided by the internal revenue code of 1986, and similar state provisions. the annual limitation may result in the expiration of certain net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards before their utilization. stock-based compensation stock-based compensation expense is measured at the date of grant and is based on the estimated fair value of the award. compensation cost is recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period for options and restricted stock unit, or rsu, awards and on an accelerated basis for performance based restricted stock unit, or prsu, awards. we recognize stock-based compensation expense associated with prsu grants when we determine the achievement of performance conditions is probable. in determining the fair value of stock options and employee stock purchase plan, espp, purchases, we estimate the grant date fair value, and the resulting stock-based compensation expense, using the black-scholes option-pricing model. we estimate the grant date fair value of rsu and prsu awards based on the grant date share price. we account for stock-based compensation arrangements with non-employees using a fair value approach. the fair value of these options is measured using the black-scholes option-pricing model reflecting the same assumptions as applied to employee options in each of the reported periods, other than the expected life, which is assumed to be the remaining contractual life of the option. the compensation expenses of these arrangements are subject to remeasurement over the vesting terms as earned. for the six months ended june 30, 2016 and 2015, we recorded stock-based compensation expense of $3.3 million and $1.1 million, respectively. at june 30, 2016, our unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to unvested stock options, net of estimated forfeitures, was $15.0 million, which we expect to recognize over a weighted-average period of 3.2 years. unrecognized compensation expense related to rsus at june 30, 2016 was $9.5 million which we expect to recognize on a straight-line basis over a weighted-average period of 2.6 years. the black-scholes option-pricing model requires the use of highly subjective assumptions which determine the fair value of stock-based awards. these assumptions include: expected term --the expected term represents the period that stock-based awards are expected to be outstanding. we used the simplified method to determine the expected term, which is based on the mid-point between the vesting date and the end of the contractual term. expected volatility --since we were privately held until our initial public offering in february 2015 and did not have any trading history for our common stock, the expected volatility was estimated based on the average volatility for comparable publicly traded life sciences, including molecular diagnostics, companies over a period equal to the expected term of the stock option grants. when selecting comparable publicly traded life sciences, including molecular diagnostics, companies on which we based our expected stock price volatility, we selected companies with comparable characteristics to us, including enterprise value, risk profiles, position within the industry, and with historical share price information sufficient to meet the expected life of the stock-based awards. the historical volatility data was computed using the daily closing prices for the selected companies\\' shares during the equivalent period of the calculated expected term of the stock-based awards. we will continue to apply this process until a sufficient amount of historical information regarding the volatility of our own stock price becomes available. risk-free interest rate --the risk-free interest rate is based on the u.s. treasury zero coupon issues in effect at the time of grant for periods corresponding with the expected term of an option. dividend yield --we have never paid dividends on our common stock and have no plans to pay dividends on our common stock. therefore, we used an expected dividend yield of zero. in addition to the black-scholes assumptions, we estimate our forfeiture rate based on an analysis of our actual forfeitures and will continue to evaluate the adequacy of the forfeiture rate based on actual forfeiture experience, analysis of employee turnover behavior, and other factors. the impact from any forfeiture rate adjustment would be recognized in full in the period of adjustment and if the actual number of future forfeitures differs from our estimates, we might be required to record adjustments to stock-based compensation in future periods. historically, for all periods prior to our initial public offering, the fair values of the shares of common stock underlying our share-based awards were estimated on each grant date by our board of directors. in order to determine the fair value of our common stock underlying option grants, our board of directors considered, among other things, contemporaneous valuations of our common stock prepared by an independent third-party valuation firm in accordance with the guidance provided by the american institute of certified public accountants practice guide, valuation of privately-held-company equity securities issued as compensation . given the absence of a public trading market for our common stock, our board of directors exercised reasonable judgment and considered a number of objective and subjective factors to determine the best estimate of the fair value of our common stock, including our stage of development; progress of our research and development efforts; our operating and financial performance, including our levels of available capital resources; the rights, preferences and privileges of our convertible preferred stock relative to those of our common stock; sales of our convertible preferred stock in arms\\'-length transactions; the valuation of publicly traded companies in our industry, as well as recently completed mergers and acquisitions of peer companies; equity market conditions affecting comparable public companies; and the lack of marketability of our common stock. in determining a fair value for our common stock, we estimated the enterprise value of our business using the market approach or option pricing back-solve method. the estimated enterprise value was then allocated to the common stock using the option pricing method, or opm, and the probability weighted expected return method, or pwerm, or the hybrid method. the hybrid method applied the pwerm utilizing the probability of two public offering exit scenarios with a low and high value, and the opm was utilized in the remaining private scenario. for valuations after the completion of our initial public offering, the fair value of each share of underlying common stock is the closing price of our common stock as reported on the date of grant. results of operations comparison of the three months ended june 30, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands except for percentage changes) three months ended june 30, dollar % change change revenue $

was due to increased test volume, which resulted in increased cash collections, as well as the commencement of payments from cms for tests provided to medicare patients. approximately $0.6 million of revenue in the three months ended june 30, 2016 was from cash collections for tests delivered in 2015. we recorded $0.8 million of revenue in the three months ended june 30, 2016 on an accrual basis. the increase in revenue of $6.5 million for the six months ended june 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 was due to increased test volume, which resulted in increased cash collections, as well as the commencement of payments from cms for tests provided to medicare patients. approximately $2.4 million of revenue in the six months ended june 30, 2016 was from cash collections for tests delivered in 2015. we recorded $1.3 million of revenue in the six months ended june 30, 2016 on an accrual basis. cost of revenue the increase in the cost of revenue of $2.6 million for the three months ended june 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 was primarily due to costs associated with increased test volume. for the three months ended june 30, 2016, the number of billed test results delivered increased to approximately 12,100 from approximately 4,400 for the same period in 2015. reflecting the increased test volumes, reagent and laboratory materials costs increased by $0.9 million, costs of other materials associated with fulfilling orders increased by $0.7 million, and allocated technology and facilities-related expenses increased by $0.6 million. personnel costs increased by $0.5 million reflecting increased headcount and increased time spent processing revenue-generating tests. the increase in the cost of revenue of $5.4 million for the six months ended june 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 was primarily due to costs associated with increased test volume. for the six months ended june 30, 2016, the number of billed test results delivered increased to approximately 21,800 from approximately 6,700 for the same period in 2015. reflecting the increased test volumes, reagent and laboratory materials costs increased by $1.6 million and costs of other materials associated with fulfilling orders increased by $1.4 million. personnel costs increased by $1.1 million reflecting increased headcount and increased time spent processing revenue-generating tests. allocated technology and facilities-related expenses increased by $0.8 million. costs associated with equipment and equipment maintenance increased by $0.5 million. research and development research and development expenses decreased by $1.1 million for the three months ended june 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. reagent and laboratory materials costs decreased by $1.6 million in the three months ended june 30, 2016 as validation sequencing activity in 2015 was principally related to the expansion of our test menu introduced in october 2015. costs allocated to research and development decreased by $0.6 million, reflecting an increased allocation of resources to cost of revenue, to address increased test volumes. in addition, consulting costs decreased by $0.3 million due to the completion of a sample collection project in 2015. these decreases in research and development expenses were partially offset by an increase in personnel costs of $1.8 million reflecting headcount increases relating to the continued development of our assay platforms. the increase in research and development expenses of $1.1 million for the six months ended june 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 was primarily driven by costs related to the continued development of our assay platforms. personnel costs increased by $4.1 million reflecting additional headcount. this cost increase was partially offset by a decrease in costs of reagents and laboratory materials of $2.1 million. reagent and laboratory materials costs were lower in the six months ended june 30, 2016 as validation sequencing activity in the first six months of 2015 was principally related to the expansion of our test menu introduced in october 2015. in addition, costs allocated to research and development decreased by $0.8 million, reflecting an increased allocation of resources to cost of revenue, to address increased test volumes. selling and marketing the increase in selling and marketing expenses of $0.7 million for the three months ended june 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 was due primarily to increased personnel costs of $1.4 million, consisting primarily of a $0.9 million increase in compensation and benefits relating to an increase in headcount, and increased sales commissions of $0.4 million. in addition, costs associated with software and software development increased by $0.3 million as compared with the same period in 2015 and allocations of technology and facilities-related expenses increased by $0.1 million. these cost increases were partially offset by reductions of $0.9 million in market collaboration costs due to the termination of certain collaboration projects and reductions in other consulting costs of $0.3 million. the increase in selling and marketing expenses of $3.0 million for the six months ended june 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 was due primarily to increased personnel costs of $3.3 million, primarily reflecting a $1.9 million increase in compensation and benefits relating to an increase in headcount, increased sales commissions of $1.0 million and stock-based compensation and severance costs of $0.4 million primarily associated with the program to streamline our organization. in addition, costs associated with software and software licenses increased by $0.7 million and allocations of technology and facilities-related expenses increased by $0.2 million as compared with the six months ended june 30, 2015. these cost increases were partially offset by a reduction of $1.1 million in market collaboration costs due to the termination of certain collaboration projects and reductions in other consulting costs of $0.4 million. general and administrative the increase in general and administrative expenses of $1.6 million for the three months ended june 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 was primarily due to increased rent expense of $1.6 million reflecting rent expense for our new production facility in san francisco. we will continue to record all rent expense for our new facility to general and administrative expense until the facility is operational and occupied, which we expect to occur in the fourth quarter of 2016, at which time rent expense will be allocated to other departments based on usage by those departments. personnel costs increased by $0.8 million principally reflecting increased headcount and stock-based compensation costs, and a $0.3 million increase in consulting fees. in addition, billings and collection costs increased by $0.2 million, reflecting increased billing-related cash collections. these cost increases were partially offset by reduced recruiting costs of $0.3 million and reduced travel costs of $0.2 million while overall headcount continued to increase, we slowed the pace of headcount growth in order to control costs. in addition, office and computer equipment expense decreased by $0.3 million and allocations of technology and facilities-related expenses decreased by $0.1 million. the decrease in office and computer equipment costs is due to costs incurred in 2015 relating to expansion of facilities. the decrease in allocations of technology and facilities-related expenses was due to increased allocations of resources to other business areas. the increase in general and administrative expenses of $3.7 million for the six months ended june 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 was primarily due to increased facilities costs of $2.6 million reflecting new facilities leases executed late in the first quarter of 2015 and in subsequent periods. in february 2016, we began recognizing rent expense for our new production facility in san francisco. rent expense relating to our new facility was $1.5 million for the six months ended june 30, 2016 and we recorded this cost as general and administrative expense. personnel costs increased by $1.8 million principally reflecting increased headcount but also including severance costs of $0.2 million associated with the program to streamline our organization. billings and collection costs increased by $0.4 million, reflecting increased billing-related cash collections. these cost increases were partially offset by reduced recruiting and related travel costs of $0.3 million. in addition, office and computer equipment expense decreased by $0.2 million reflecting costs incurred in 2015 but not in 2016 relating to expansion of facilities. in addition, allocations of technology and facilities-related expenses decreased by $0.3 million due to higher facilities usage relating to other functional groups. other income (expense), net the net decrease in other income (expense) of $0.6 million for the three months ended june 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 was principally due to losses realized on the impairment and disposal of facility assets of $0.7 million in 2016 partially offset by a decrease in business property tax expense recognized of $0.1 million. the net decrease in other income (expense) of $0.8 million for the six months ended june 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 was principally due to losses realized on the impairment and disposal of facility assets in 2016 of $0.9 million, partially offset by a decrease in business property tax expense recognized of $0.1 million and an increase in interest income earned of $0.1 million. interest expense the increase in interest expense of $65,000 and $121,0000 for the three and six months ended june 30, 2016, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2015, was principally due to interest expense relating to term loans under the loan agreement. we began borrowing activity pursuant to the loan agreement in july 2015. liquidity and capital resources liquidity and capital expenditures we have incurred net losses since our inception. for the six months ended june 30, 2016 and 2015, we had net losses of $50.4 million and $42.9 million, respectively, and we expect to incur additional losses in the foreseeable future. at june 30, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of $225.4 million. to date, we have generated only limited revenue, and we may never achieve revenue sufficient to offset our expenses. since inception, our operations have been financed primarily by net proceeds of $202.3 million from sales of our convertible preferred stock and net proceeds of approximately $105.7 million from our initial public offering. we have entered into various capital lease agreements for an aggregate financing amount of $8.2 million from inception through june 30, 2016 to obtain laboratory equipment. the terms of our capital leases are typically three years. interest rates for currently outstanding capital leases range from 3.8% to 4.3% and the leases are secured by the underlying equipment. in addition, in july 2015, we entered into a loan and security agreement, or loan agreement, with a bank under which term loans for purchases of equipment up to an aggregate of $15.0 million are available in tranches not to exceed $2.5 million. the term loans under the loan agreement bear interest at a floating rate equal to 0.25% below the prime rate as published in the wall street journal effective on the date the change in the prime rate becomes effective. we are required to repay the outstanding principal and accrued but unpaid interest on each tranche in equal monthly installments beginning one month after each advance and ending on july 17, 2020, or the term date. any then-unpaid principal and interest on advances under the loan agreement are payable on the term date. our obligations under the loan agreement are secured by a security interest on substantially all of our assets, excluding our intellectual property and certain other assets. see note 5, \"commitments and contingencies\" in the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements. at june 30, 2016, we had borrowed a total of $12.5 million under the loan agreement and our outstanding balance payable to the lender at june 30, 2016 was $11.1 million. we anticipate our capital expenditures for the full year 2016 will be approximately $9.6 million and will be funded principally by advances under the loan agreement and reimbursement for a portion of the costs of leasehold improvements we plan to make to our new production facility. see note 5, \"commitments and contingencies\" in the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements. at june 30, 2016 and december 31, 2015, we had $90.2 million and $127.0 million, respectively, of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. our primary uses of cash are to fund our operations as we continue to grow our business. cash used to fund operating expenses is affected by the timing of when we pay expenses, as reflected in the change in our outstanding accounts payable and accrued expenses. we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents as of june 30, 2016 will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for at least the next 12 months. however, we may in the future elect to finance operations by selling equity or debt securities. if we raise funds by issuing equity securities, dilution to stockholders may result. any equity securities issued may also provide for rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock. if we raise funds by issuing debt securities, these debt securities would have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock. the terms of debt securities or borrowings could impose significant restrictions on our operations. if additional funding is required, there can be no assurance that additional funds will be available to us on acceptable terms on a timely basis, if at all, or that we will generate sufficient cash from operations to adequately fund our operating needs or sustain profitability. if we are unable to raise additional capital or generate sufficient cash from operations to adequately fund our operations, we will need to curtail planned activities to reduce costs. doing so will likely have an unfavorable effect on our ability to execute on our business plan. the following table summarizes our cash flows for the six months ended june 30, 2016 and 2015: six months ended june 30, (in thousands) cash used in operating activities $ (42,396 ) $ (38,459 ) cash used in investing activities (3,906 ) (127,128 ) cash provided by financing activities 4,651 106,108 cash flows from operating activities for the six months ended june 30, 2016, cash used in operating activities of $42.4 million principally resulted from our net loss of $50.4 million offset by non-cash charges of $3.3 million for stock-based compensation, $3.3 million for depreciation and amortization and $0.9 million for losses on disposals of assets. the net effect on cash of changes in net operating assets was $0.6 million and was due principally to the net effect of increases in accrued expenses and decreases in prepaid expenses and other current assets. for the six months ended june 30, 2015, cash used in operating activities of $38.5 million principally resulted from our net loss of $42.9 million offset by non-cash charges of $2.3 million for depreciation and amortization, and $1.1 million for stock-based compensation. the net effect on cash of changes in net operating assets of $0.7 million was primarily due to an increase in accounts payable of $1.4 million due to timing of payments to our vendors. this was partially offset by the application of cash to prepaid balances of equipment maintenance contracts, d&o insurance and software licenses. cash flows from investing activities for the six months ended june 30, 2016, cash used in investing activities of $3.9 million was primarily due to purchases of property and equipment of $3.8 million. for the six months ended june 30, 2015, cash used in investing activities of $127.2 million was primarily due to purchases of marketable securities exceeding proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities by $123.7 million and purchases of property and equipment of $3.4 million. cash flows from financing activities cash provided by financing activities for the six months ended june 30, 2016 of $4.7 million consisted of borrowings of $5.0 million under the loan agreement and cash received from exercises of stock options of $1.4 million, partially offset by loan payments of $0.9 million and capital lease obligations payments of $0.7 million. cash provided by financing activities for the six months ended june 30, 2015 of $106.1 million consisted primarily of $107.1 million of net proceeds from our initial public offering completed in february 2015, partially offset by payments of $1.0 million on our capital lease obligations. contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations, including interest, as of june 30, 2016 (in thousands): contractual obligations: remainder of 2016 2017 and 2018 2019 and 2020 2021 and beyond

our wafer fabrication facility is near kansas city, missouri; our sales and marketing and logistical centers are located in taipei, taiwan, and shanghai, shenzhen and hong kong , china, and san jose and westlake village, ca; and our ic design company, anachip, is located in hsinchu, taiwan. we also have regional sales offices or representatives in: derbyshire, england; toulouse, france; frankfurt, germany; and in various cities in the united states. our strategy is to continue to enhance our position as a global supplier of standard semiconductor products, and to continue to add other product lines, such as power management products, using our packaging technology capability. the principal elements of this strategy include the following: focus on technology innovation -- in 2006, we strengthened our product design centers in dallas, san jose, shanghai and taipei to position our design engineers to work more closely with our customers and enable diodes to deliver a stream of innovative solutions in our targeted product categories. by working closely with our market-leading customers and tailoring our r&d efforts to their specific needs, we have gained a superior understanding of their requirements and can anticipate and quickly respond to their emerging product development needs. as the trend toward converged consumer electronics devices in ever smaller form factors continues to drive demand for products that can help our customers achieve enhanced performance and energy efficiencies while shrinking printed circuit board real estate, we have been able to introduce market-leading innovative products to address our customer needs. sales of new products for the quarter amounted to 33.5% of total sales, compared to 24.9% a year ago, and this growth includes the contribution of the anachip acquisition as well as the acquired sbr a technology. new product revenue was driven by products in sub-miniature array, qfn, powerdi o 323, powerdi o 123, powerdi o 5, sbr a and schottky platforms in both the discrete and analog product lines. diodes released 54 products covering 13 product families during the second quarter of 2007. expand our available market opportunities -- we intend to aggressively maximize our opportunities in the standard semiconductor market as well as in related markets where we can apply our semiconductor design and manufacturing expertise. a key element of this is leveraging our highly integrated packaging expertise through our application specific multi-chip circuit (asmcc) product platform, which consists of standard arrays, function specific arrays and end-equipment specific arrays. we intend to achieve this by: o continuing to focus on increasing packaging integration, particularly with our existing standard array and customer-specific array products, in order to achieve products with increased circuit density, reduced component count and lower overall product cost; o expanding existing products and developing new products in our function specific array lines, which combine multiple discrete semiconductor components to achieve specific common electronic device functionality at a low cost; and o developing new product lines, which we refer to as end-equipment specific arrays, which combine discrete components with logic and/or standard analog circuits to provide system-level solutions for high-volume, high-growth applications. our extension into the hall effect sensors and power management product lines provides us with a market opportunity that focuses on high growth areas that have higher margins. in addition, these product lines share essentially the same customers and end-user applications as our current product lines, providing us with cross-selling opportunities, and helping us to expand and deepen our customer relationships. overall, we believe that our strong results for the year reflect our customers\\' acceptance of our broader product lines and reaffirm our confidence in the soundness of our strategic direction. in order to extend our distribution network in europe, on july 9, 2007, we signed a distribution agreement with silica, an avnet, inc. (nyse:avt) company, and one of the largest suppliers and distributors of semiconductor products in europe. silica is a highly specialized semiconductor distributor with 36 branch offices throughout europe providing customers with a broad portfolio of semiconductor products along with in-depth technical and logistic support as well as other value-added services. silica\\'s specialized focus on semiconductor products and extensive local presence in europe will improve our ability to service our customer\\'s logistic requirements, enhance our competitiveness and strengthen our brand recognition. since entering the european market in 2001, we have consistently grown our sales and expanded our market share, successfully building our european customer base in the automotive, communications and industrial end-markets. we believe that europe will make an important contribution to diodes\\' long term profitable growth. maintain intense customer focus -- we intend to strengthen and deepen our customer relationships. we believe that continued focus on customer service would increase our net sales, operating performance and overall market share. to accomplish this, we intend to continue to closely collaborate with our customers to design products that meet their specific needs. a critical element of this strategy is to continue to further reduce our design cycle time in order to quickly provide our customers with innovative products. diodes\\' customer service culture pervades all levels of our organization and has enabled us to build a customer base that includes global industry leaders in the computing, consumer electronics, communications, industrial and automotive sectors. our engineers work with customers side by side to understand their requirements and to help them reduce component count and footprint and to improve functionality. and our flexible manufacturing facilities will quickly shift production to accommodate customer needs and scale up production on customized application specific devices. this level of responsiveness has enabled diodes to stay ahead of the curve on our customers\\' ongoing and future needs and expand our position with each new generation of end devices. we deliver world-class service support to our clients from our sales, engineering and marketing teams in the united states, asia and europe. enhance manufacturing efficiency -- a key element of our success is our overall low-cost base. we operate two state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities in china. during 2006, we invested $32 million in new manufacturing capacity and increased our total output by 43% to over 11.8 billion devices per year, and in the first half of 2007, we have invested $27.3 million. we remain committed to achieving the lowest cost and highest quality position in our industry by our relentless pursuit of continuous improvement in manufacturing efficiencies through product innovation and economies of scale. we will continue to deliver the highest quality products and services our customers have come to expect as well as maintain our customer-centered approach to adjust and reconfigure our production schedule to deliver devices of outstanding reliability for high-volume applications within very tight delivery schedules. we believe that our approach to manufacturing excellence, quality, flexibility and reliability at a very competitive cost is key to our business strategy and success, and has positioned diodes as a premier supplier to some of the leading oems in the world. in order to optimize the synergies from the business integration with anachip, which we acquired in january 2006, we announced plans to consolidate our analog wafer probe and final test operations from hsinchu, taiwan to our manufacturing facilities in shanghai, china. we recorded a restructuring charge of $1.8 million in the second quarter of 2007 (see note g). pursue selective strategic acquisitions -- as part of our strategy to expand our standard semiconductor product offerings and to maximize our market opportunities, we may acquire discrete, analog or mixed-signal technologies, product lines or companies in order to support our asmcc product platform and enhance our standard and new product offerings. in december 2005, we announced the acquisition of anachip corporation, a fabless taiwanese semiconductor company focused on analog ics designed for specific applications, and h eadquartered in the hsinchu science park in taiwan . this acquisition, which was completed on january 10, 2006, fits in the center of our long-t erm strategy. anachip\\'s main product focus is power management ics. the analog devices they produce are used in lcd monitor/tv\\'s, wireless lan 802.11 access points, brushless dc motor fans, portable dvd players, datacom devices, adsl modems, tv/satellite set-top boxes, and power supplies. anachip brings a design team with strong capabilities in a range of targeted analog and power management technologies. in november 2006, we purchased the net assets of apd semiconductor, inc., a privately held u.s.-based fabless semiconductor company. apd semiconductor is headquartered in redwood city, california, with a sales, application, and administration center in taipei, taiwan. apd semiconductor\\'s main product focus is its patented and trademarked super barrier rectifier (\"sbr\") technology. utilizing a low cost ic wafer process, the sbr technology uses a mos cellular design to replace standard traditional schottky or pn junction diodes. the sbr technology uses an innovative-patented process technique that allows its key parameters to be easily tuned to optimize any customer applications. this adaptive and scalable technology allows for increased power saving with better efficiency and reliability at higher operating temperatures for end user applications like digital audio players, dc/dc converters. ac/dc power supplies, lcd monitors, power-over-ethernet (poe), power factor correction (pfc) and tv/satellite set-top boxes. the sbr technology offers industry-leading products like the sbr20u100ct, which has the lowest forward voltage and highest efficiency and power saving in its class. the apd acquisition will enhance our product capabilities and technology leadership position in the low pin count standard product semiconductor market and expand our product capabilities across important segments of our end-markets. in implementing these strategies, the following factors have affected, and, we believe, will continue to affect, our results of operations: * since 1998, we have experienced increases in the demand for our products, and substantial pressure from our customers and competitors to reduce the selling price of our products. we expect future increases in net income to result primarily from increases in sales volume and improvements in product mix in order to offset reduced average selling prices of our products. * as part of our growth strategy, in january 2006 we acquired anachip corporation, a fabless taiwanese semiconductor company focused on the standard analog markets. at december 31, 2005, we had purchased an aggregate of 9,433,613 shares (or approximately 18.9%) of the 50,000,000 outstanding shares of the capital stock of anachip. on january 10, 2006, (the closing date of the acquisition) we purchased an additional 40,470,212 shares and therefore, we hold approximately 99.81% of the anachip capital stock. as of result of the additional anachip interest acquired during 2006, anachip was consolidated beginning the first fiscal quarter of 2006. the purchase price of the acquisition was nt$20 per share (approximately us$31 million). the acquired intangible assets include patents and trademarks of $2.4 million with an approximately 10-year weighted-average useful life. the acquisition was accretive to our 2006 earnings, and is expected to be accretive to our full-year 2007 earnings. * in 2006 and the six months ended june 30, 2007, 28.2% and 32.7%, respectively, of our net sales were derived from products introduced within the last three years, which we term \"new products,\" compared to 15.3% in 2005. the significant increase in new products primarily resulted from the anachip acquisition. new products generally have gross profit margins that are higher than the margins of our standard products. we expect net sales derived from new products to increase in absolute terms, although our net sales of new products as a percentage of our net sales will depend on the demand for our standard products, as well as our product mix. * our gross profit margin was 31.9% in the second quarter of 2007, compared to 33.2% in the same period of 2006 and 32.1% in the first quarter of 2007. our gross margin percentage was lower sequentially as average selling prices have been declining during the second quarter of 2007 due to market competition. furthermore, we are still under process of integrating analog product line. with the addition of anachip, we can now pursue adjacent product categories that significantly expand our growth opportunities as well as gross margin potential. * as of june 30, 2007, we had invested approximately $151.7 million in our asian manufacturing facilities. for the six months ended june 30, 2007, we invested approximately $27.3 million in capital expenditures, primarily in our asian manufacturing facilities, which was approximately 14.5% of revenue. we expect our full-year capital expenditures to be at the upper-end of our guidance of 10-12% of total revenue. our capital expenditure objective is to meet increased demand by investing in equipment to increase our manufacturing efficiencies, and to integrate the analog business. * during the second quarter of 2007, the percentage of our net sales derived from our asian subsidiaries was 75.5%, compared to 71.6% in the first quarter of 2007, 71.9% in 2006 and 65.4% in 2005. we expect our net sales to the asian market to continue to increase as a percentage of our total net sales as a result of our customers\\' continuing to shift their manufacturing of electronic products from the u.s. to asia. * we have increased our investment in research and development from $2.1 million, or 2.5% of net sales, in the second quarter of 2006 to $3.2 million, or 3.3% of net sales, in the second quarter of 2007, as we completed the anachip acquisition, continued investing in enhancing current product features, and developed new products. we continue to seek to hire qualified engineers who fit our focus on proprietary discrete and analog processes and packaging technologies. our goal is to maintain research and development expenses at approximately 3.0% of net sales as we bring additional proprietary devices to the market. * during 2005, we sold 3.2 million (split adjusted) shares of our common stock in a follow-on public offering, raising approximately $72.0 million (net of commissions and expenses). we used approximately $31 million of the net proceeds to acquire anachip and will use the remaining net proceeds from this offering for working capital and other general corporate purposes, including additional acquisitions. * on november 3, 2006, we completed the agreement to purchase the assets of apd semiconductor, a privately held u.s.-based fabless discrete semiconductor company. headquartered in redwood city, california, apd\\'s main product focus is its patented and trademarked super barrier rectifier™️ technology. the initial purchase price of the acquisition was $8.4 million in addition to a potential earn-out provision with respect to pre-defined covered products. apd revenue was $0.5 million for 2006 and $1.5 million for the first six months of 2007. the apd acquisition is aligned with our strategy of strengthening our technology leadership in the discrete semiconductor market and expanding our product capabilities across important segments of our end-markets. * on october 5, 2006, we issued $230 million in aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due on october 1, 2026. the notes pay interest semiannually at a rate of 2.25% per annum. the notes will be convertible, in certain circumstances, into cash up to the principal amount, and any conversion value above the principal amount will be redeemable, at our option, into cash or shares of common stock, at an initial conversion rate of 25.6419 shares per $1,000 principal amount of notes (which represents an initial conversion price of $39.00 per share, split adjusted). the initial conversion price represents an approximate 40% conversion premium, based on the sale price of $27.92 (split adjusted) of company\\'s common stock on october 5, 2006. we expect this transaction to be accretive to earnings per share given the current short-term interest environment and intend to use the net proceeds from this offering for working capital and other general corporate purposes, including acquisitions. related parties we conduct business with one related party, lite-on semiconductor corporation (\"lsc\") (and its subsidiaries and affiliates) and one significant party, keylink international (formerly xing international) (and its subsidiaries). lsc is our largest stockholder and owned 22.0% of our outstanding common stock as of june 30, 2007. keylink international is our 5% joint venture partner in diodes-china and diodes-shanghai. c.h. chen, our previous president and chief executive officer, and vice chairman of our board of directors, is also vice chairman of lsc, and raymond soong, the chairman of our board of directors, is the chairman of lite-on technology corporation, a significant shareholder of lsc, as well as the chairman of lsc. the audit committee of our board of directors reviews related party transactions for potential conflict of interest situations, and approves or ratifies all such transactions, in accordance with such procedures as it may adopt from time to time. we believe that related party transactions are on terms no less favorable to us than would be obtained from unaffiliated third parties. during the three and six months ended june 30, 2007, we sold silicon wafers to lsc totaling 6.4% and 6.8% (6.5% in 2006 and 9.6% in 2005) of our net sales, respectively, making lsc our largest customer. also for the three months ended june 30, 2007, 10.7% (14.2% in 2006 and 14.7% in 2005) of our net sales were from discrete semiconductor products purchased from lsc for subsequent sale by us, making lsc our largest outside supplier. we believe such transactions are on terms no less favorable to us than could be obtained from unaffiliated third parties. the audit committee of our board of directors has approved the contracts associated with these related party transactions. during the three and six months ended june 30, 2007, we sold silicon wafers to companies owned by keylink international totaling 0.9% and 0.4% (0.4% in 2006 and 0.6% in 2005) of our net sales, respectively. also for the three months ended june 30, 2007, 1.5% (2.3% in 2006 and 3.0% in 2005) of our net sales were from discrete semiconductor products purchased from companies owned by keylink international. in addition, diodes-china and diodes-shanghai lease their manufacturing facilities from, and subcontract a portion of their manufacturing process (metal plating and environmental services) to, keylink international. we also pay a consulting fee to keylink international. in 2006, and the three and six months ended june 30, 2007, we paid keylink international an aggregate of $7.9 million, 2.2 million and $4.3 million, respectively, with respect to these items, respectively. we believe such transactions are on terms no less favorable to us than could be obtained from unaffiliated third parties. the audit committee of our board of directors has approved the contracts associated with these related party transactions. in december 2005, we entered into a definitive stock purchase agreement to acquire anachip corporation, a taiwanese fabless analog ic company, and headquartered in the hsinchu science park in taiwan. the selling shareholders included lsc (which owned approximately 60% of anachip\\'s outstanding capital stock), and two taiwanese venture capital firms (together owning approximately 20% of anachip\\'s stock), as well as current and former anachip employees. at december 31, 2005, we had purchased an aggregate of 9,433,613 shares (or approximately 18.9%) of the 50,000,000 outstanding shares of the capital stock of anachip. on january 10, 2006 (the closing date of the acquisition), we purchased an additional 40,470,212 shares and therefore, we now hold approximately 99.81% of the anachip capital stock. concurrent with the acquisition, anachip entered into a wafer purchase agreement with lsc, pursuant to which lsc will sell to anachip, according to anachip\\'s requirements, during the two year period ending on december 31, 2007, wafers of the same or similar type, and meeting the same specifications, as those wafers purchased from lsc by anachip at the time of the acquisition. anachip will purchase such wafers on terms (including purchase price, delivery schedule, and payment terms) no less favorable to anachip than those terms on which anachip purchased such wafers from lsc at the time of the acquisition, provided, however, that the purchase price will be the lower of the current price or the most favorable customer pricing. if the price of raw wafers increases by more than 20% within any six-month period, anachip and lsc will renegotiate in good faith the price of wafers to reflect the cost increase. available information our internet address is http://www.diodes.com . we make available, free of charge through our internet website, our annual reports on form 10-k, quarterly

affect our operating results and financial condition. o the semiconductor business is highly competitive, and increased competition may harm our business and our operating results. o we receive a significant portion of our net sales from a single customer. in addition, this customer is also our largest external supplier and is a related party. the loss of this customer or supplier could harm our business and results of operations. o delays in initiation of production at new facilities, implementing new production techniques or resolving problems associated with technical equipment malfunctions could adversely affect our manufacturing efficiencies. o we are and will continue to be under continuous pressure from our customers and competitors to reduce the price of our products, which could adversely affect our growth and profit margins. o our customer orders are subject to cancellation or modification usually with no penalty. high volumes of order cancellation or reductions in quantities ordered could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. o new technologies could result in the development of new products by our competitors and a decrease in demand for our products, and we may not be able to develop new products to satisfy changes in demand, which could result in a decrease in net sales and loss of market share. o we may be subject to claims of infringement of third-party intellectual property rights or demands that we license third-party technology, which could result in significant expense and reduction in our intellectual property rights. o we depend on third-party suppliers for timely deliveries of raw materials, parts and equipment, as well as finished products from other manufacturers, and our results of operations could be adversely affected if we are unable to obtain adequate supplies in a timely manner. o if we do not succeed in continuing to vertically integrate our business, we will not realize the cost and other efficiencies we anticipate and our ability to compete, profit margins and results of operations may suffer. o part of our growth strategy involves identifying and acquiring companies with complementary product lines or customers. we may be unable to identify suitable acquisition candidates or consummate desired acquisitions and, if we do make any acquisitions, we may be unable to successfully integrate any acquired companies with our operations. o we are subject to many environmental laws and regulations that could affect our operations or result in significant expenses. o our products may be found to be defective and, as a result, product liability claims may be asserted against us, which may harm our business and our reputation with our customers. o we may fail to attract or retain the qualified technical, sales, marketing and management personnel required to operate our business successfully. o we may not be able to maintain our growth or achieve future growth and such growth may place a strain on our management and on our systems and resources. o our business may be adversely affected by obsolete inventories as a result of changes in demand for our products and change in life cycles of our products. o if oems do not design our products into their applications, a portion of our net sales may be adversely affected. o we rely heavily on our internal electronic information and communications systems, and any system outage could adversely affect our business and results of operations. o we are subject to interest rate risk that could have an adverse effect on our cost of working capital and interest expenses. o if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls or discover material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting, we may not be able to report our financial results accurately or detect fraud, which could harm our business and the trading price of our common stock. o terrorist attacks, or threats or occurrences of other terrorist activities whether in the united states or internationally may affect the markets in which our common stock trades, the markets in which we operate and our profitability. o we currently have a significant amount of debt following our convertible senior notes offering. our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to meet our payment obligations under the notes and our other debt. risks related to our international operations o our international operations subject us to risks that could adversely affect our operations. o we have significant operations and assets in china, taiwan and hong kong and, as a result, will be subject to risks inherent in doing business in those jurisdictions, which may adversely affect our financial performance. o we are subject to foreign currency risk as a result of our international operations. o we may not continue to receive preferential tax treatment in china, thereby increasing our income tax expense and reducing our net income. o the distribution of any earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to the united states may be subject to u.s. income taxes, thus reducing our net income. risks related to our common stock o variations in our quarterly operating results may cause our stock price to be volatile. o we may enter into future acquisitions and take certain actions in connection with such acquisitions that could affect the price of our common stock. o our directors, executive officers and significant stockholders hold a substantial portion of our common stock, which may lead to conflicts with other stockholders over corporate transactions and other corporate matters. o our early corporate records are incomplete. as a result, we may have difficulty in assessing and defending against claims relating to rights to our common stock purporting to arise during periods for which our records are incomplete. o conversion of our convertible senior notes will dilute the ownership interest of existing shareholders, including holders who had previously converted their notes. financial operations overview net sales we generate a substantial portion of our net sales through the sale of discrete and analog semiconductor products designed and manufactured by third parties or us. we also generate a portion of our net sales from outsourcing manufacturing capacity to third parties and from the sale of silicon wafers to manufacturers of discrete semiconductor components. we serve customers across diversified industries, including the consumer electronics, computing, industrial, communications and automotive markets. we recognize revenue from product sales when title to and risk of loss of the product have passed to the customer, there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, the sale price is fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured. these criteria are generally met upon shipment to our customers. net sales is stated net of reserves for pricing adjustments, discounts, rebates and returns. the principal factors that have affected or could affect our net sales from period to period are: o the condition of the economy in general and of the semiconductor industry in particular; o our customers\\' adjustments in their order levels; o changes in our pricing policies or the pricing policies of our competitors or suppliers; o the termination of key supplier relationships; o the rate of introduction of new products to, and acceptance by, our customers; o our ability to compete effectively with our current and future competitors; o our ability to enter into and renew key corporate and strategic relationships with our customers, vendors and strategic alliances; o changes in foreign currency exchange rates; o a major disruption of our information technology infrastructure; and o unforeseen catastrophic events, such as armed conflict, terrorism, fires, typhoons and earthquakes. cost of goods sold cost of goods sold includes manufacturing costs for our semiconductor products and our wafers. these costs include raw materials used in our manufacturing processes as well as the labor costs and overhead expenses. cost of goods sold is also impacted by yield improvements, capacity utilization and manufacturing efficiencies. in addition, cost of goods sold includes the cost of products that we purchase from other manufacturers and sell to our customers. cost of goods sold is also affected by inventory obsolescence if our inventory management is not efficient. selling, general and administrative expenses selling, general and administrative expenses relate primarily to compensation and associated expenses for personnel in general management, sales and marketing, information technology, engineering, human resources, procurement, planning and finance, and sales commissions, as well as outside legal, accounting and consulting expenses, share-based compensation expenses, and other operating expenses. we expect our selling, general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we hire additional personnel and expand our sales, marketing and engineering efforts and information technology infrastructure. research and development expenses research and development expenses consist of compensation and associated costs of employees engaged in research and development projects, as well as materials and equipment used for these projects. research and development expenses are primarily associated with our wafer facility near kansas city, missouri, our analog ic facilities in taipei, taiwan, and our manufacturing facilities in china, as well as our engineers at our u.s. headquarters. all research and development expenses are expensed as incurred, and we expect our research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we invest in new technologies and product lines. interest income / expense interest income consists of interest earned on our cash and investment balances. interest expense consists of interest payable on our outstanding credit facilities. income tax provision we recognized income tax expense of $2.2 million for the second quarter of 2007, resulting in an effective tax rate of 14.8%, as compared to 19.8% in the same period of last year. our lower effective tax rate reflected the decrease in the amount of expected repatriation of earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, partially offset by the impact of one of our china subsidiaries, diodes-shanghai, which is now subject to 7.5% preferential tax rate from 2007 through 2009, compared to a 0% tax rate in 2006. going forward, we anticipate our tax rate to be in the 14 to 16% range. we continue to take advantage of available strategies to optimize our tax rate across the jurisdictions in which we operate. critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. on an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts, inventory reserves and income taxes, among others. our estimates are based upon historical experiences, market trends and financial forecasts and projections, and upon various other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances and at that certain point in time. actual results may differ, significantly at times, from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. we believe the following critical accounting policies and estimates affect the significant estimates and judgments we use in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, and may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity than others. revenue recognition we recognize revenue when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists, when delivery has occurred, when our price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and when collectability of the receivable is reasonably assured. these elements are met when title to the products is passed to the buyers, which is generally when our product is shipped. we reduce revenue in the period of sale for estimates of product returns, distributor price adjustments and other allowances, the majority of which are related to our north american operations. our reserve estimates are based upon historical data as well as projections of revenues, distributor inventories, price adjustments, average selling prices and market conditions. actual returns and adjustments could be significantly different from our estimates and provisions, resulting in an adjustment to revenues. inventory reserves inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value. cost is determined principally by the first-in, first-out method. on an on- going basis, we evaluate our inventory, both finished goods and raw material, for obsolescence and slow-moving items. this evaluation includes analysis of sales levels, sales projections, and purchases by item, as well as raw material usage related to our manufacturing facilities. based upon this analysis, as well as an inventory aging analysis, we accrue a reserve for obsolete and slow-moving inventory. if future demand or market conditions are different than our current estimates, an inventory adjustment may be required, and would be reflected in cost of goods sold in the period the revision is made. accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate. this process involves using an asset and liability approach whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for differences in the financial reporting bases and tax bases of our assets and liabilities. significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities. management continually evaluates its deferred tax asset as to whether it is likely that the deferred tax assets will be realized. if management ever determined that our deferred tax asset was not likely to be realized, a write-down of the asset would be required and would be reflected as an expense in the accompanying period. we are involved in various tax matters, with respect to some of which the outcome is uncertain. for purposes of evaluating whether or not a tax position is uncertain (1) we presume the tax position will be examined by the relevant taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information, (2) technical merits of a tax position are derived from authorities such as legislation and statutes, legislative intent, regulations, rulings and case law and their applicability to the facts and circumstances of the tax position, and (3) each tax position is evaluated without consideration of the possibility of offset or aggregation with other tax positions taken. a tax benefit from an uncertain position may be recognized only if it is \"more likely than not\" that the position is sustainable, based on its technical merits and the tax benefit of a qualifying position is the largest amount of tax benefits that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority having full knowledge of all relevant information. we adopted the provisions of fin48 effective january 1, 2007. as a result of the implementation of fin48, during the first quarter of 2007, we increased our liability for unrecognized tax benefits by approximately $2.0 million, which was accounted for as a reduction to the january 1, 2007, balance of retained earnings. allowance for doubtful accounts management evaluates the collectability of our accounts receivable based upon a combination of factors, including the current business environment and historical experience. if we are aware of a customer\\'s inability to meet its financial obligations to us, we record an allowance to reduce the receivable to the amount we reasonably believe we will be able to collect from the customer. for all other customers, we record an allowance based upon the amount of time the receivables are past due. if actual accounts receivable collections differ from these estimates, an adjustment to the allowance may be necessary with a resulting effect on operating expense. goodwill as of june 30, 2007, goodwill was $24.9 million ($19.8 million related to the anachip acquisition, $4.2 million related to the fabtech acquisition, and $0.9 million related to diodes-china). we account for goodwill in accordance with sfas no. 142, \" goodwill and other intangible assets, \" for which goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually. impairment of long-lived assets we assess the impairment of long-lived assets, including goodwill, on an on-going basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. our impairment review process is based upon (i) an income approach from a discounted cash flow analysis, which uses our estimates of revenues, costs and expenses, as well as market growth rates, and (ii) a market multiples approach which measures the value of an asset through an analysis of recent sales or offerings or comparable public entities. if ever the carrying value of the goodwill is determined to be less than the fair value of the underlying asset, a write-down of the asset will be required, with the resulting expense charged in the period that the impairment was determined. share-based compensation effective in january 1, 2006, we adopted sfas no. 123r, \"share-based payments,\" using the modified prospective method. under sfas 123r, we are required to select a valuation technique or option-pricing model that meets the criteria as stated in the standard, which includes a binomial model and the black-scholes model. at the present time, the company is continuing to use the black-scholes model, consistent with prior period valuations under sfas 123. no modifications were made to any outstanding share-options prior to the adoption of sfas 123r. the adoption of sfas 123r, applying the \"modified prospective method,\" as elected by the company, requires the company to value stock options prior to its adoption of sfas 123 under the fair value method and expense these amounts over the stock options\\' remaining vesting period. this resulted in the company expensing $1.4 million and $2.9 million in the three and six months ended june 30, 2007, respectively, which was recorded within the cost of goods sold expense, general and administrative expense and research and development expense on the company\\'s condensed consolidated income statement. in addition, sfas 123r requires the company to reflect any tax savings resulting from tax deductions in excess of expense reflected in its financial statements as a financing cash inflow in its statement of cash flows rather than as an operating cash flow as in prior periods (see \"note j - share-based compensation\" for details). the company has changed its primary award type to employees from stock options to stock awards as an improved method of employee reward and retention. in general, the company extended the vesting period from three years to four years, and reduced the number of shares subject to the award by a factor of three. the company had 677,346 restricted stock grants outstanding as of june 30, 2007. the restricted stock grants will be recorded each quarter as a non-cash operating expense item. as of june 30, 2007, there was $14.8 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested share-based compensation. this cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 3.2 years. in the three months and six months ended june 30, 2007, an expense of $0.8 million and $1.7 million was recorded, respectively. in addition to the expense, the effects of the restricted stock grants are included in the diluted shares outstanding calculation. results of operations for the three months ended june 30, 2006 and 2007 the following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, the percentage that certain items in the statement of income bear to net sales and the percentage dollar increase (decrease) of such items from period to period. percent of net sales three months ended june 30, percentage dollar increase (decrease) 2006 2007 \\'06 to \\'07 net sales 100 100 16.4 cost of goods

june 30, 2006. this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this quarterly report (in thousands) . 2006 2007 net sales $ 82,712 $ 96,283 net sales increased approximately $13.6 million for the three months ended june 30, 2007, compared to the same period last year. the 16.4% increase in net sales was due to a 27.4% increase in units sold, partially offset by a 8.6% decrease in average selling prices (\"asp\") primarily due to market price competition as well as demand induced product mix changes. 2006 2007 cost of goods sold $ 55,279 $ 65,605 gross profit $ 27,433 $ 30,678 gross profit margin percentage 33.2 % 31.9 % cost of goods sold increased approximately $10.3 million, or 18.7%, for the three months ended june 30, 2007 compared to the same period in 2006. as a percent of sales, cost of goods sold increased from 66.8% for the three months ended june 30, 2006 to 68.1% for the three months ended june 30, 2007. our average unit cost (\"aup\") decreased 6.8% from the second quarter of 2006. as per sfas 123r, included in cost of goods sold was $0.1 million of non-cash, stock option compensation expense related to our manufacturing facilities. gross profit increased in the second quarter of 2007 by approximately $3.2 million, or 11.8%, compared to the three months ended june 30, 2006. gross margin, as a percentage of net sales, decreased to 31.9% for the three months ended june 30, 2007, compared to 33.2% for the same period of 2006, as the aup decrease was not sufficient to offset the asp decline. 2006 2007 sg&a $ 11,716 $ 13,397 sg&a for the three months ended june 30, 2007 increased approximately $1.6 million, or 14.3%, compared to the same period last year, due primarily to (i) share grant expense increase of $0.5 million in the second quarter of 2007, (ii) $0.3 million increase in outside sales commissions due to increased shares, (iii) $0.8 million increase in wages associated with increased sales, and (iv) $0.3 million increase in audit, legal and consulting expenses associated with sarbanes-oxley act compliance, as well as $0.1 million increase in depreciation expense. sg&a, as a percentage of sales, was 13.9% in the current quarter, down from 14.2% in the prior-year quarter, due primarily to the increased sales. 2006 2007 r&d $ 2,077 $ 3,156 investment in r&d in the current quarter was $3.2 million, an increase of approximately $1.1 million from the same period last year. of the $1.1 million increase, compensation costs increased $0.8 million as a result of hiring additional engineers, $0.1 million reflected diodes\\' investment in developing new products in discrete, analog and mixed signal, while $0.1 million was associated with apd patents amortization. r&d, as a percentage of sales, was 3.3% in the second quarter 2007 compared to 2.5% in the same period in 2006. 2006 2007 restructuring costs and impairment of fixed assets $ $ 1,770 in the second quarter of 2007 we recorded approximately $1.8 million in restructuring costs related to the consolidation of our analog wafer probe and final test operations from hsinchu, taiwan to our manufacturing facilities in shanghai, china. the expense was comprised of approximately $0.8 million in termination and severance costs, $0.3 million in impairment of fixed assets and $0.3 million in relocation charges. 2006 2007 interest income $ 1,004 $ 4,285 interest income for the three months ended june 30, 2007 was $4.3 million, compared to $1.0 million in the same period in 2006, due primarily to interest income earned on short-term investment securities purchased with the proceeds of the $230 million convertible bonds. 2006 2007 interest expense $ $ 1,696 interest expense for the three months ended june 30, 2007 was $1.7 million, compared to $0.1 million in the same period 2006, due primarily to interest expense related to the 2.25% convertible bonds, and to a lesser extent, $0.3 million in amortization related convertible bonds issuance costs. 2006 2007 income tax provision $ 2,885 $ 2,221 we recognized income tax expense of $2.2 million for the second quarter of 2007, resulting in an effective tax rate of 14.8%, as compared to 19.8% in the same period of last year. our lower effective tax rate reflected the decrease in the amount of expected repatriation of earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, partially offset by the impact of one of our china subsidiaries, diodes-shanghai, which is now subject to 7.5% preferential tax rate from 2007 through 2009, compared to a 0% tax rate in 2006. going forward, we anticipate our tax rate to be in the 14 to 16% range. we continue to take advantage of available strategies to optimize our tax rate across the jurisdictions in which we operate. 2006 2007 minority interest $ $ minority interest in joint venture earnings represented the minority investor\\'s share of the earnings of diodes-china, diodes-shanghai and diodes-anachip for the period. the reciprocal investment in the above subsidiaries and their equity balances were eliminated in the consolidations of our financial statements, and the activities of diodes-china, diodes-shanghai and anachip were included therein. as of june 30, 2007, we had 95% controlling interests in diodes-china and diodes-shanghai, and a 99.81% controlling interest in anachip. results of operations for the six months ended june 30, 2006 and 2007 the following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, the percentage that certain items in the statement

ended june 30, 2006 to 68.0% for the six months ended june 30, 2007. aup decreased 7.9% year-over-year. as per sfas 123r, included in cost of goods sold was $0.2 million of non-cash, stock option compensation expense related to our manufacturing facilities. gross profit increased in the six months of 2007 by approximately $8.6 million, or 16.6%, compared to the six months ended june 30, 2006. gross margin, as a percentage of net sales, decreased to 32.0% for the six months ended june 30, 2007, compared to 33.0% for the same period of 2006, as the aup decrease was not sufficient to offset the asp decline. 2006 2007 sg&a $ 23,000 $ 26,075 sg&a for the six months ended june 30, 2007 increased approximately $3.1 million, or 13.4%, compared to the same period last year, due primarily to (i) share-based compensation expense increase of $0.5 million in the first six months of 2007, (ii) $0.5 million increase in outside sales commissions, $1.0 million increase in wages and marketing expenses associated with increased sales, and (iii) $0.5 million audit, legal and consulting expenses associated with sarbanes-oxley act compliance, as well as $0.3 million increase in depreciation expense. sg&a, as a percentage of sales, was 13.8% in the first six months of 2007, down from 14.7% in the same period of last year, due primarily to the increased sales. 2006 2007 r&d $ 4,043 $ 6,101 investment in r&d in the first six months of 2007 was $6.1 million, an increase of approximately $2.1 million from that in the same period last year. of the $2.1 million increase, compensation costs increased $1.3 million as a result of hiring additional engineers, $0.3 million reflected diodes\\' investment in developing new products in discrete, analog and mixed signal, while $0.3 million was associated with apd patents amortization. r&d, as a percentage of sales, was 3.2% of the first six months of 2007 sales compared to 2.6% in the same period 2006. 2006 2007 restructuring costs and impairment of fixed assets $ $ 1,770 in the second quarter of 2007 we recorded approximately $1.8 million in restructuring costs related to the consolidation of our analog wafer probe and final test operations from hsinchu, taiwan to our manufacturing facilities in shanghai, china. the expense was comprised of approximately $0.8 million in termination and severance costs, $0.3 million in impairment of fixed assets and $0.3 million in relocation charges. 2006 2007 interest income $ 1,738 $ 8,320 interest income for the six months ended june 30, 2007 was $8.3 million, compared to $1.7 million in the same period in 2006, due primarily to interest income earned on short-term investment securities purchased with the proceeds of the $230 million convertible bonds. 2006 2007 interest expense $ $ 3,421 interest expense for the six months ended june 30, 2007 was $3.4 million, compared to $0.3 million in the same period 2006, due primarily to interest expense related to the 2.25% convertible bonds, and to a lesser extent, $0.6 million in amortization related convertible bonds issuance costs. 2006 2007 income tax provision $ 4,575 $ 4,879 we recognized income tax expense of $4.9 million for the six months ended june 30, 2007, resulting in an effective tax rate of 15.7%, as compared to 17.8% in the same period of last year. our lower effective tax rate reflected the decrease in the amount of expected repatriation of earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, partially offset by the impact of one of our china subsidiaries, diodes-shanghai, which is now subject to 7.5% preferential tax rate from 2007 through 2009, compared to a 0% tax rate in 2006. going forward, we anticipate our tax rate to be in the 14 to 16% range. we continue to take advantage of available strategies to optimize our tax rate across the jurisdictions in which we operate. financial condition liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of liquidity are cash, funds from operations and borrowings under our credit facilities. our primary liquidity requirements have been to meet our inventory and capital expenditure needs. at december 31, 2006 and june 30, 2007, our working capital was $395.4 million and $419.9 million, respectively. we anticipate our working capital position will be sufficient for at least the next 12 months. during 2005, we sold 3.2 million (stock split adjusted) shares of our common stock in a follow-on public offering, raising approximately $72 million (net of commissions and expenses). we used approximately $31 million of the net proceeds in connection with the anachip acquisition, and approximately $9 million for the apd acquisition, and w e intend to use the remaining net proceeds from this offering for working capital and other general corporate purposes, including additional acquisitions. on october 5, 2006, we issued $230 million in aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due on october 1, 2026. we received approximately $224 million of net proceeds from this debt offering and intend to use the net proceeds from this offering for working capital and other general corporate purposes, including acquisitions. capital expenditures for the three and six months ended june 30, 2007 were $14.9 million and $27.3 million, respectively. our capital expenditures for these periods were primarily related to manufacturing expansion in our facilities in china and, to a lesser extent, our wafer fabrication facility in the u.s. y ear-to-date capital expenditures were at approximately 14.5% of revenue as of june 30, 2007, ahead of our 10-12% full-year estimate as we continue to invest for expected growth. we had originally planned our 2007 capital expenditures to be at the upper end of our guidance, and front-loaded in the first half of the year to allow us to take advantage of projected second half growth prospects. our first half actual at 14.5% of revenue is in-line with this plan. we are continuing to evaluate our second half plans in light of our original plan and the developing market environment. discussion of cash flow cash and short-term investments have increased from $339.9 million at december 31, 2006, to $352.5 million at june 30, 2007. operating activities net cash provided by operating activities during the first six months of 2007 was $28.0 million, resulting primarily from $25.3 million of net income in this period, as well as $13.0 million in depreciation and amortization. net cash provided by operating activities was $35.2 million for the same period in 2006. net cash provided by operations decreased $7.2 million from the first six months of 2007 compared to the same period in 2006. this decrease resulted primarily from a $5.0 million increase in operating assets changes during the six-month period ($11.1 million increase in accounts receivable, $11.2 million decrease in inventory, and $4.9 million increase in other assets), and $11.4 million decrease in liabilities, offset by $4.6 million increase in our net income (from $20.7 million in 2006 to $25.3 million in 2007), $0.6 million increase in non-cash, share-based compensation expense, and $3.4 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense. investing activities net cash used in investing activities was $42.1 million for the first six months of 2007 compared to $59.6 million for the same period of 2006. the $17.5 million decrease in investing activities primary relates to the $19.0 million payment for anachip acquisition (net of cash acquired) in the first quarter of 2006, and a $6.3 million decrease in capital expenditures, partially offset by a $7.7 million decrease in investment in available for sale securities. financing activities our financing activities include net borrowings, share issuances and excess tax benefits associated with stock options exercised. net cash provided by financing activities totaled $7.7 million in the first six months of 2007 compared to $0.3 million net cash used in the same period of 2006. this increase is primarily the result of an increase of $2.4 million in proceeds from stock option exercised during the first six month of 2007. debt instruments on august 29, 2006, we amended our u.s. credit arrangements with union bank of california, n.a. (union bank). under the second amendment to our amended and restated credit agreement, we have available a revolving credit commitment of up to $20.0 million, including a $5.0 million letter of credit sub-facility. in addition, and in connection with this amendment, one of our subsidiaries, diodes-fabtech, also amended and restated a term note and related agreement with respect to an existing term loan arrangement, which we refer to as the fabtech term loan. after giving effect to this amendment, the principal amount under the fabtech term loan was increased to $5.0 million. the revolving credit commitment expires on august 29, 2008. the fabtech term loan, which amortizes monthly, matures on august 29, 2010. as of june 30, 2007, we had no amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility, and there was $3.4 million outstanding under the fabtech term loan. loans to diodes incorporated under our credit facility are guaranteed by fabtech, and in turn, the fabtech term loan is guaranteed by diodes incorporated. the purpose of the revolving credit facility is to provide cash for domestic working capital purposes, and to fund permitted acquisitions. any amounts borrowed under the credit facility and the fabtech term loan are collateralized by all of diodes incorporated\\'s and fabtech\\'s accounts, instruments, chattel paper, documents, general intangibles, inventory, equipment, furniture and fixtures, pursuant to security agreements entered into by diodes incorporated and fabtech in connection with these credit arrangements. both amounts borrowed under the revolving credit facility and the fabtech term loan bear interest at libor plus 1.15%. at june 30, 2007, the effective rate under both the credit agreement and the fabtech term loan was 6.51%. the credit agreement contains covenants that require us to maintain a leverage ratio not greater than 3.25 to 1.0, an interest expense coverage ratio of not less than 2.0 to 1 and a current ratio of not less than 1.0 to 1. it also requires us to achieve a net profit before taxes, as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, for the two consecutive fiscal quarters ending on that date of not less than $1. the credit agreement permits us to pay dividends to our stockholders to the extent that any such dividends declared or paid in any fiscal year do not exceed an amount equal to 50% of our net profit after taxes for such fiscal year. however, it limits our ability to dispose of assets, incur additional indebtedness, engage in liquidation or merger, acquisition, partnership or other combination (except permitted acquisitions). the credit agreement also contains customary representations, warranties, affirmative and negative covenants and events of default. as of june 30, 2007, we were in compliance with the bank covenants. the agreements governing the fabtech term loan do not contain any financial or negative covenants. however, they provide that a default under our credit agreement will cause a cross-default under the fabtech term loan. as of june 30, 2007, our asia subsidiaries have available lines of credit of up to an aggregate of $26.7 million, with a number of chinese and taiwanese financial institutions. these lines of credit, except for one taiwanese credit facility, are collateralized by its premises, are unsecured, uncommitted and, in some instances, may be repayable on demand. loans under these lines of credit bear interest at libor or similar indices plus a specified margin. as of june 30, 2007, diodes-shanghai owed $0.8 million under a note to one of our customers, which debt was incurred in connection with our investing in manufacturing equipment. we repay this unsecured and interest-free note in quarterly price concession installments, with any remaining balance due in july 2008. on october 12, 2006, we issued and sold convertible senior notes with an aggregate principal amount of $230 million due 2026 (\"notes\"), which pay 2.25% interest per annum on the principal amount of the notes, payable semi-annually in arrears on april 1 and october 1 of each year, beginning on april 1, 2007. interest will accrue on the notes from and including october 12, 2006 or from and including the last date in respect of which interest has been paid or provided for, as the case may be, to, but excluding, the next interest payment date or maturity date, as the case may be. commencing with the six-month period beginning october 1, 2011, and for each six-month period thereafter, we will, on the interest payment date for such interest period, pay contingent interest to the holders of the notes under certain circumstances and in amounts described in the indenture. note holders may require us to repurchase all or a portion of their notes upon a fundamental change, as defined, at a repurchase price in cash equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date. future minimum interest payments related to the notes as of december 31, 2006 are $5.2 million for each year from 2007 through 2011. future minimum payments related to the notes as of december 31, 2006 for 2011 and thereafter include $77.5 million in interest and $230 million in principal for a total of $307.5 million. in connection with the issuance of the notes, we incurred approximately $6.2 million of issuance costs, which primarily consisted of investment banker fees, legal and accounting fees. these costs are classified within other assets and are amortized as a component of interest expense using the straight-line method over the life of the notes from issuance through october 12, 2011. off-balance sheet arrangements we do not have any transactions, arrangements and other relationships with unconsolidated entities that will affect our liquidity or capital resources. we have no special purpose entities that provided off-balance sheet financing, liquidity or market or credit risk support, nor do we engage in leasing, swap agreements, or outsource of research and development services, that could expose us to liability that is not reflected on the face of our financial statements.']"
