It enables members to stream content through various internet-connected devices like TVs, digital video players, television set-top boxes, and mobile devices.

Netflix's financial performance and stock trends showed a mix of positive and negative signals:
Financial Performance: Based on the performance up to September 2022, Netflix was anticipated to have increment in the revenue  from the previous fiscal year. However, its net income saw a  decrease from FY 2021, amounting to US$4.49 billion. The company's profit margin also declined to 14% from 17% in FY 2021, affected by higher expenses. Earnings per share (EPS) went down to US$10.10 from US$11.55 in FY 2021.
Stock Trends: In  2022, Netflix's stock price has reached to a "hold" rating point at around $230 at the end of September. Despite experiencing its first-ever decline in memberships in the first half of FY22, Netflix reported a return to subscriber growth, with paid memberships up by 1% versus the previous quarter. However, the growth rate on a year-over-year basis continued to slow down, now well into low-single digits at 5%. The company's operating margin in Q3 was 19%, slightly below the target for the year of 20%, and it was expected that the operating margin in Q4 would be 50% lower than the previous year.
Netflix management forecasted a further 4.5 million paid membership additions in the final quarter of FY22, representing year-over-year growth of 2.6%. The company also planned to launch an ad-supported subscription plan in various markets, which is expected to help longer-term growth, despite the immediate impact on Q4 results being uncertain. Netflix aimed to improve revenue through new membership models and combat lost revenue from account sharing.
